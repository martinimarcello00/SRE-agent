# üìù Results of the Analysis

## üîç Steps Performed
- Called kubectl_get to list pods across all namespaces (kubectl get pods --all-namespaces).
- Ran kubectl_get to list pods across all namespaces with wide output (equivalent to: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide).
- Ran kubectl_describe on pod geo-6b4b89b5f5-w8vtg in namespace test-hotel-reservation.
- Fetched the last 200 lines of logs from pod test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-w8vtg (container: hotel-reserv-geo) using kubectl_logs.
- Ran kubectl_get to list pods in namespace test-hotel-reservation with wide output (kubectl get pods -n test-hotel-reservation -o wide).
- Ran kubectl_get for services in namespace test-hotel-reservation with wide output (kubectl get services -n test-hotel-reservation -o wide).

## üí° Insights Gathered
- kubectl get pods across all namespaces shows almost all pods in Running state (one Succeeded job); no Pending, CrashLoopBackOff, or Failed pods observed ‚Äî control-plane and application pods (test-hotel-reservation) appear healthy.
- The test-hotel-reservation geo pod (geo-6b4b89b5f5-w8vtg) is in CrashLoopBackOff with 5 restarts ‚Äî a failing geo service is likely causing errors for that component.
- Pod test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-w8vtg is in CrashLoopBackOff: container 'hotel-reserv-geo' repeatedly starts then terminates with Exit Code 2 (RestartCount=5). Image yinfangchen/geo:app3 was pulled successfully and kubelet events show Back-off restarting ‚Äî indicates the application process is failing on startup (not an image pull or OOM issue).
- The geo service fails at startup because it cannot reach the MongoDB instance (Read database URL: mongodb-geo:27777) ‚Äî logs show ‚Äúno reachable servers‚Äù and a panic, which explains the CrashLoopBackOff.
- The mongodb-geo pod is Running (IP 10.244.1.14) with 0 restarts, so the MongoDB instance appears up; therefore geo‚Äôs CrashLoopBackOff is likely due to connection/configuration issues (wrong host/port, DNS, or auth) rather than the DB pod being down.
- The mongodb-geo Service is exposed on port 27017 (ClusterIP 10.96.15.217), but the geo pod‚Äôs logs show it trying to connect to mongodb-geo:27777 ‚Äî a port mismatch likely causing the ‚Äúno reachable servers‚Äù error and the geo CrashLoopBackOff.

## üö® Final Report (Root Cause)
> Diagnosis:
The geo service is crashing because it tries to connect to MongoDB at mongodb-geo:27777 but the MongoDB Service (and pod) are listening on the default port 27017. The port mismatch causes connection failures (‚Äúno reachable servers‚Äù), a panic on start, and CrashLoopBackOff.

Reasoning:
Investigation steps and evidence:

- Cluster pod summary showed the geo pod (test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-w8vtg) in CrashLoopBackOff with RestartCount=5. Other pods (including mongodb-geo) are Running.
- Describing the geo pod and container events showed repeated starts followed by termination with Exit Code 2 and kubelet Back-off restarting ‚Äî indicating the application process is failing at startup rather than image pull or OOM.
- Logs from the geo container show it reads the DB URL as: mongodb-geo:27777 and then errors with ‚Äúno reachable servers‚Äù followed by a panic. This explains the exit code and restart loop.
- The mongodb-geo pod is Running (has an IP) and the mongodb-geo Service exists as ClusterIP with port 27017. The MongoDB Service/pod are on port 27017 (default), not 27777.

Reasoning: The geo service is resolving the service name (mongodb-geo) but is attempting to use port 27777 which does not match the actual MongoDB port (27017). This port mismatch causes connection attempts to fail with ‚Äúno reachable servers‚Äù, causing the geo process to panic at startup and CrashLoopBackOff. Other causes (image pull failure, OOM, pod not running, DNS failure) were ruled out because the image was pulled successfully, the mongo pod is Running, kubelet events show restarts due to application exit, and logs show explicit connection errors pointing to the wrong port. The most likely root cause is a configuration error (wrong port configured in geo‚Äôs environment/config or an incorrect Service port mapping).

## üõ†Ô∏è Mitigation Plan Strategy
Root cause: the geo application is configured to connect to mongodb-geo on port 27777 while the MongoDB Service exposes port 27017, causing DB connection failures and a CrashLoopBackOff. Recommended resolution: update the geo deployment/ConfigMap/Helm values to use port 27017 and rollout the deployment. As a short-lived emergency workaround, you may temporarily patch the mongodb-geo Service port to 27777, but this is higher risk and must be reverted. Verify connectivity and logs, commit the fix to source control, and add tests/alerts to prevent recurrence.

## üìã Detailed Mitigation Steps
1. Confirm current state: kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation get pods; kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation get svc mongodb-geo -o yaml; kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation describe pod <geo-pod>; kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation logs <geo-pod> -c <geo-container> --tail=200
2. Locate configuration for port 27777: search Deployment, ConfigMaps, Secrets and Helm values for 27777 (e.g. kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation get deploy geo -o yaml | grep -n "27777"; kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation get configmap -o yaml | grep -n "27777")
3. Recommended permanent fix ‚Äî change geo to use 27017: if port is set via env var use kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation set env deployment/geo MONGO_PORT=27017 or kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation edit deployment geo and replace 27777 ‚Üí 27017; if in a ConfigMap edit it and then rollout restart the deployment
4. If using GitOps/Helm, update the chart/values or manifest in source control and deploy the corrected manifests so the fix is permanent (do not only edit cluster resources)
5. Restart/rollout geo to pick up new config: kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation rollout restart deployment geo and then kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation rollout status deployment geo
6. Temporary emergency workaround (only if immediate restore required): patch the mongodb-geo Service port to 27777 while keeping targetPort=27017: kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation patch svc mongodb-geo --type='json' -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/ports/0/port","value":27777}]' ‚Äî revert as soon as app config is fixed
7. Verify connectivity and logs after changes: kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation get pods; kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation logs <new-geo-pod> -c <geo-container> --tail=200; look for successful Mongo connection and absence of "no reachable servers" or panic traces
8. Optional cluster connectivity test: kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation run --rm -it conn-test --image=nicolaka/netshoot --restart=Never -- /bin/bash; then inside: nc -vz mongodb-geo 27017 or mongo --host mongodb-geo --port 27017 --eval "db.runCommand({ping:1})"
9. Rollback plan: if the change causes regressions, undo the deployment: kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation rollout undo deployment geo; if Service was patched, revert its port to 27017 via kubectl patch or edit
10. Collect diagnostics if issue persists: kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation logs <geo-pod> --previous -c <geo-container>; kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation describe pod <geo-pod>; kubectl -n test-hotel-reservation get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'; save pre/post YAMLs of deployment and service
11. Post-remediation tasks: if temporary Service patch used, revert it to 27017 and confirm geo now uses 27017; commit fixes to repo (Helm/kustomize/manifests) to prevent drift
12. Hardening & prevention: add startup retries/backoff to geo to avoid immediate panic on transient DB errors; add readiness/liveness probes appropriate to app behavior; add CI/PR checks or staging integration tests that validate DB host:port and smoke connectivity
13. Monitoring & alerting: add alert rule for CrashLoopBackOff for geo and log-based alerts for "no reachable servers" or DB connection failures; document the correct DB port in runbooks and architecture diagrams

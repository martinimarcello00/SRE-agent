# 2025-09-08 11:42:38 - Hotel Missconf fetch incident RAG

    # üìù Results of the Analysis

## ü©∫ Symptoms
- geo pod in CrashLoopBackOff with ~12 restarts (container hotel-reserv-geo)
- Last container termination Exit Code 2 after ~10s runtime
- Container logs show panic: "no reachable servers" while initializing DB connection to mongodb-geo:27777
- mongodb-geo pod is Running and exposes MongoDB on container port 27017 (launched with --auth)
- Service mongodb-geo exists as ClusterIP in namespace test-hotel-reservation
- Image pulls for geo succeed (application runtime error, not image pull)
- Prometheus returned no restart metrics for geo pods
- Attempt to fetch logs for an earlier pod name failed because pod was recreated under a different name

## üîç Steps Performed
- Executed kubectl_get to list all pods across all namespaces with wide output (kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide).
- Ran kubectl_describe on pod 'geo' in namespace 'test-hotel-reservation' to inspect container state, exit code, and recent events.
- Called kubectl_logs to retrieve the last 200 lines of pod 'geo' in namespace 'test-hotel-reservation'; the tool returned a "Resource pod geo not found" error.
- Ran kubectl_get pods in namespace 'test-hotel-reservation' with -o wide to list pods and their statuses (kubectl get pods -n test-hotel-reservation -o wide).
- Ran kubectl_get across all namespaces with wide output (kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide) to list current pods, statuses, pod IPs, and node assignments.
- Ran kubectl_describe on pod geo-6b4b89b5f5-d74mv in namespace test-hotel-reservation.
- Fetched the last 500 lines of logs from pod 'geo-6b4b89b5f5-d74mv' in namespace 'test-hotel-reservation' using kubectl_logs.
- Executed kubectl_get on pods in namespace test-hotel-reservation (kubectl_get) and retrieved a JSON list showing mongodb-geo-5ff578bcb8-z2vm2 in Running state.
- Ran prometheus_query with query 'kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total{namespace="test-hotel-reservation", pod=~"geo.*"}' to fetch container restart metrics for geo pods.
- Ran kubectl_describe on pod mongodb-geo-5ff578bcb8-z2vm2 in namespace test-hotel-reservation.
- Ran kubectl_get to list Services in namespace 'test-hotel-reservation' (kubectl get svc -n test-hotel-reservation -o json).
- Queried the incident document store using chroma_query_documents for related geo/mongodb incidents; the tool returned empty results (no documents).
- Called submit_final_diagnosis tool to record the diagnosis; the tool returned a validation error: symptoms must be a list (payload used a string).

## üí° Insights Gathered
- Pod 'geo' in namespace 'test-hotel-reservation' is in CrashLoopBackOff (0/1) with 12 restarts (last failure ~2m20s ago) ‚Äî a clear symptom likely causing service disruption.
- Container 'hotel-reserv-geo' is crashing on startup ‚Äî last termination had Exit Code 2 and the process ran only ~10s before exiting, producing the CrashLoopBackOff; image pulls succeed, pointing to an application startup/runtime error rather than an image-pull problem.
- Attempt to fetch logs for pod 'geo' failed with error "Resource pod geo not found" ‚Äî the pod appears to no longer exist (deleted or recreated under a different name), so recent logs are not available for diagnosing the startup crash.
- Pod 'geo-6b4b89b5f5-d74mv' in namespace 'test-hotel-reservation' is in CrashLoopBackOff (12 restarts, last ~3m14s ago) ‚Äî the geo component has been recreated under a new name and is actively crashing on startup. Target this pod for log retrieval to capture the startup/runtime error.
- Pod 'geo-6b4b89b5f5-d74mv' remains in CrashLoopBackOff with 12 restarts and is now observed with pod IP 10.244.1.30 on node 'kind-worker' ‚Äî the failing instance is present (so fetching its logs/describe on this specific pod and node is now possible).
- kubectl describe of geo-6b4b89b5f5-d74mv (node kind-worker, IP 10.244.1.30) shows the container hotel-reserv-geo repeatedly in CrashLoopBackOff (BackOff events x176) and the last termination was Exit Code 2 after ~10s. The image yinfangchen/geo:app3 (sha256:bc56ea15136b8d1330e9433bd7cba225882e635e5e4ee071be6ad9510032bb39) is successfully pulled ‚Äî this isolates the failure to an application startup/runtime error inside this specific image on the node, not an image-pull or scheduling issue.
- Container startup is panicking with "no reachable servers" while initializing a DB connection to mongodb-geo:27777 ‚Äî the geo service cannot reach its MongoDB backend, causing the CrashLoopBackOff.
- Pod mongodb-geo-5ff578bcb8-z2vm2 is Running in namespace test-hotel-reservation ‚Äî the MongoDB backend pod exists and is up. This shifts the likely cause of the geo service‚Äôs ‚Äúno reachable servers‚Äù panic to networking, service/port configuration, DNS, or auth issues rather than a missing DB pod.
- Prometheus returned no data for kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total{namespace="test-hotel-reservation", pod=~"geo.*"} ‚Äî there are no restart metrics for the geo pods in Prometheus (possible scraping/label mismatch or metric absence), so Prometheus cannot be used right now to confirm restart history.
- The mongodb-geo pod is Running and was started with --auth and exposes MongoDB on container port 27017. This indicates the geo service‚Äôs ‚Äúno reachable servers‚Äù is likely due to authentication or a port/service target mismatch (earlier observed geo tried mongodb-geo:27777) rather than the DB pod being down.
- The Service 'mongodb-geo' exists as a ClusterIP in namespace 'test-hotel-reservation', so the MongoDB service DNS/Service object is present ‚Äî this makes a missing service unlikely and points the remaining causes of the geo app‚Äôs ‚Äúno reachable servers‚Äù to a port mismatch (geo tried mongodb-geo:27777 while MongoDB listens on 27017) or authentication issues.
- A search of the incident/document store (chroma) for multiple geo/MongoDB-related query texts returned no matching documents ‚Äî there are no additional historical notes or stored incident records to augment diagnosis.
- Attempt to submit the final diagnosis failed due to a tool validation error ‚Äî the submit_final_diagnosis call rejected the payload because 'symptoms' was a string instead of the required list. The diagnosis (port mismatch: geo -> mongodb-geo:27777 vs MongoDB on 27017, and missing auth) was not recorded; re-submit with correctly structured fields so the mitigation can be applied.

## üö® Final Report (Root Cause)
> Diagnosis:
The geo service fails on startup because it cannot reach the MongoDB backend. Root cause is a configuration mismatch: geo is attempting to connect to mongodb-geo:27777 while the MongoDB instance listens on port 27017 and runs with --auth. This port mismatch (and missing/incorrect authentication) prevents successful DB connection, causing the application panic and subsequent CrashLoopBackOff.

Reasoning:
kubectl describe/logs show the geo container panicking with "no reachable servers" when dialing mongodb-geo:27777. The mongodb-geo pod is up and running (container port 27017) and the ClusterIP service exists, so the DB is not down. The geo image pulls and starts but exits quickly with Exit Code 2, matching a runtime initialization failure. Because the mongo pod was started with --auth and exposes 27017, a connection attempt to 27777 will fail at TCP level (no server listening) producing "no reachable servers". Even if the port were corrected, the geo service may also be missing credentials for authenticated MongoDB, which would cause auth failures. Prometheus returned no restart metrics (scrape/label mismatch) and chroma query returned no prior incident documents, so no stored playbook was available. Given these facts, the most likely immediate cause is the port mismatch (mongodb-geo:27777 vs actual 27017) and lack of DB auth credentials, leading to startup panic and CrashLoopBackOff.

## üõ†Ô∏è Mitigation Plan Strategy
Fix the geo application's MongoDB connection by correcting the port (use 27017) and supplying proper credentials from a Kubernetes Secret, then perform a controlled rolling update and validate. If necessary use a short-lived service port mapping as a last-resort workaround. Add verification, rollback, and post-incident prevention steps.

## üìã Detailed Mitigation Steps
1. Confirm namespace and current resources: kubectl get pods,deployments,services,configmaps,secrets -n <NAMESPACE>.
2. Inspect geo Deployment and config to find DB host/port/URI and credentials: kubectl get deployment geo -n <NAMESPACE> -o yaml; kubectl get configmap -n <NAMESPACE> | grep geo; kubectl get secret -n <NAMESPACE>.
3. Inspect MongoDB service/pod to confirm listening port and auth: kubectl get pod -l app=mongodb-geo -n <NAMESPACE> -o wide; kubectl get svc mongodb-geo -n <NAMESPACE> -o yaml; kubectl logs <mongodb-pod> -n <NAMESPACE>.
4. If missing, create a Kubernetes Secret for MongoDB credentials instead of storing them in a ConfigMap: kubectl create secret generic mongodb-geo-creds --from-literal=MONGO_USER=<user> --from-literal=MONGO_PASSWORD='<pass>' -n <NAMESPACE> (or include full mongo_uri).
5. Update geo configuration to use the correct MongoDB port (27017) and inject credentials from the Secret. Either set MONGO_HOST=mongodb-geo and MONGO_PORT=27017 and mount secret via envFrom, or set a single MONGO_URI (mongodb://user:pass@mongodb-geo:27017/db?authSource=admin) using secret valueFrom.
6. Apply configuration changes and perform a rolling restart of geo: kubectl rollout restart deployment/geo -n <NAMESPACE>; monitor rollout: kubectl rollout status deployment/geo -n <NAMESPACE>.
7. Monitor geo pod logs for successful DB connection and absence of auth errors: kubectl logs deployment/geo -n <NAMESPACE> --follow.
8. If necessary, test connectivity from a debug pod: kubectl run --rm -i --tty mongo-client --image=mongo --namespace=<NAMESPACE> -- bash then mongo --host mongodb-geo --port 27017 -u <user> -p <pass> --authenticationDatabase admin.
9. If config cannot be changed quickly, as a temporary mitigation map service port 27777 to targetPort 27017 (not recommended long-term): kubectl patch svc mongodb-geo -n <NAMESPACE> --patch '{"spec":{"ports":[{"port":27777,"targetPort":27017,"name":"mongo-alt"}]}}'.
10. If auth failures persist, verify/create the MongoDB user with correct privileges and authSource via the mongo shell or admin user; check MongoDB logs for rejects.
11. If a change causes regressions, rollback the deployment: kubectl rollout undo deployment/geo -n <NAMESPACE> and revert any secret/configmap edits.
12. Perform smoke tests / readiness checks: ensure geo readiness endpoint passes, pods remain Running (no CrashLoopBackOff), and application-level functionality works.
13. Rotate credentials if they were exposed in logs or configmaps and update the Secret + Deployment accordingly.
14. Document the root cause, add CI validation for required DB env keys, and move DB creds into Secrets; add monitoring/alerts for CrashLoopBackOff and DB auth/connectivity errors.
15. Restrict Secret RBAC to required principals and schedule a short post-incident review to harden startup error handling (retries/backoff) in the geo app.

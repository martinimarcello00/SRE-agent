If necessary use a short-lived service port mapping as a last-resort workaround. Add verification, rollback, and post-incident prevention steps.\\n\\n## 📋 Detailed Mitigation Steps\\n1. Confirm namespace and current resources: kubectl get pods,deployments,services,configmaps,secrets -n <NAMESPACE>.\\n2. Inspect geo Deployment and config to find DB host/port/URI and credentials: kubectl get deployment geo -n <NAMESPACE> -o yaml; kubectl get configmap -n <NAMESPACE> | grep geo; kubectl get secret -n <NAMESPACE>.\\n3. Inspect MongoDB service/pod to confirm listening port and auth: kubectl get pod -l app=mongodb-geo -n <NAMESPACE> -o wide; kubectl get svc mongodb-geo -n <NAMESPACE> -o yaml; kubectl logs <mongodb-pod> -n <NAMESPACE>.\\n4. If missing, create a Kubernetes Secret for MongoDB credentials instead of storing them in a ConfigMap: kubectl create secret generic mongodb-geo-creds --from-literal=MONGO_USER=<user> --from-literal=MONGO_PASSWORD=\\'<pass>\\' -n <NAMESPACE> (or include full mongo_uri).\\n5. Update geo configuration to use the correct MongoDB port (27017) and inject credentials from the Secret. Either set MONGO_HOST=mongodb-geo and MONGO_PORT=27017 and mount secret via envFrom, or set a single MONGO_URI (mongodb://user:pass@mongodb-geo:27017/db?authSource=admin) using secret valueFrom.\\n6. Apply configuration changes and perform a rolling restart of geo: kubectl rollout restart deployment/geo -n <NAMESPACE>; monitor rollout: kubectl rollout status deployment/geo -n <NAMESPACE>.\\n7. Monitor geo pod logs for successful DB connection and absence of auth errors: kubectl logs deployment/geo -n <NAMESPACE> --follow.\\n8. If necessary, test connectivity from a debug pod: kubectl run --rm -i --tty mongo-client --image=mongo --namespace=<NAMESPACE> -- bash then mongo --host mongodb-geo --port 27017 -u <user> -p <pass> --authenticationDatabase admin.\\n9. If config cannot be changed quickly, as a temporary mitigation map service port 27777 to targetPort 27017 (not recommended long-term): kubectl patch svc mongodb-geo -n <NAMESPACE> --patch \\'{\"spec\":{\"ports\":[{\"port\":27777,\"targetPort\":27017,\"name\":\"mongo-alt\"}]}}\\'.\\n10. If auth failures persist, verify/create the MongoDB user with correct privileges and authSource via the mongo shell or admin user; check MongoDB logs for rejects.\\n11. If a change causes regressions, rollback the deployment: kubectl rollout undo deployment/geo -n <NAMESPACE> and revert any secret/configmap edits.\\n12. Perform smoke tests / readiness checks: ensure geo readiness endpoint passes, pods remain Running (no CrashLoopBackOff), and application-level functionality works.\\n13. Rotate credentials if they were exposed in logs or configmaps and update the Secret + Deployment accordingly.\\n14. Document the root cause, add CI validation for required DB env keys, and move DB creds into Secrets; add monitoring/alerts for CrashLoopBackOff and DB auth/connectivity errors.\\n15. Restrict Secret RBAC to required principals and schedule a short post-incident review to harden startup error handling (retries/backoff) in the geo app.\\n',\n",

Container logs explicitly show attempts to connect to \\'mongodb-geo:27777\\' followed by \\'no reachable servers\\' and a panic — a clear indication the service cannot reach/authorize to the database. The incident document found in the incident store matches this symptom set and confirms the DB is actually listening on 27017 and requires authentication. Together these observations explain why the geo container cannot establish a DB connection and crashes on startup, producing the observed CrashLoopBackOff and ContainersNotReady state. The empty Prometheus restart metric suggests monitoring gaps but does not change the root cause identified from pod status and logs.\\n\\n## 🛠️ Mitigation Plan Strategy\\n\\n\\n## 📋 Detailed Mitigation Steps\\n'],\n",

       "- Attempt to fetch container logs failed: kubectl returned \"Resource pod geo not found\" — the pod cannot be located (may have been deleted/restarted with a different name), so we currently cannot access the crashing container's logs.\n",

       "- The container hotel-reserv-geo in pod geo-6b4b89b5f5-d74mv is repeatedly crashing very quickly: Last start ~11:59:58 and finish ~12:00:09 (~11s uptime) with Exit Code 2 and RestartCount 17, now in CrashLoopBackOff. Image pull succeeded and the pod is Running on node kind-worker — this points to an application startup/runtime failure (likely bad config, missing dependency, or runtime error).\n",
       "- Application log shows a panic: \"no reachable servers\" while initializing the database connection to mongodb-geo:27777 — the geo service cannot reach its MongoDB, causing the CrashLoopBackOff.\n",
       "- Application is crashing on startup because it cannot reach MongoDB: logs show a panic with 'no reachable servers' while trying mongodb-geo:27777. A retrieved incident document confirms MongoDB actually listens on 27017 and requires authentication — the wrong port/credentials are the root cause of the CrashLoopBackOff.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 🚨 Final Report (Root Cause)\n",
       "> Diagnosis:\n",
       "The geo service is crashing on startup because it is misconfigured to connect to MongoDB on the wrong port (27777) and lacking proper authentication/credentials; this causes connection failures (no reachable servers) and the application to panic and exit with code 2, resulting in a CrashLoopBackOff.\n",
       "\n",
       "Reasoning:\n",
       "Kubernetes pod status and restart counts show the geo container repeatedly fails on startup with Exit Code 2, which points to an application runtime error. The pod is scheduled and the image is pulled successfully, so it's not a scheduling or image issue. Application logs explicitly show a panic 'no reachable servers' while attempting to connect to mongodb-geo:27777. A prior incident document retrieved from the incident store confirms MongoDB listens on the default 27017 and requires authentication. Combining these facts indicates the geo service is configured with the wrong MongoDB port and likely missing credentials; the service cannot establish a DB connection, panics during initialization, and crashes repeatedly, producing the observed CrashLoopBackOff.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 🛠️ Mitigation Plan Strategy\n",
       "Fix geo's MongoDB connection by correcting the port to 27017 and supplying credentials via a Kubernetes Secret; perform a rolling restart and verify. If immediate config change is not possible, use a short-lived service port mapping (mongodb-geo:27777 → 27017) as a temporary workaround. After recovery, apply remediation: Secrets, RBAC, CI checks, and improved startup resilience.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 📋 Detailed Mitigation Steps\n",
       "1. Confirm namespace and current state: kubectl get pods,svc,deploy -n <NAMESPACE> -o wide; identify geo and mongodb-geo pod names.\n",
       "2. Inspect failing geo pod and logs: kubectl describe pod <geo-pod-name> -n <NAMESPACE>; kubectl logs <geo-pod-name> -n <NAMESPACE> -c hotel-reserv-geo --tail=200.\n",
       "3. Verify MongoDB pod/service: kubectl get pod -l app=mongodb-geo -n <NAMESPACE> -o wide; kubectl describe pod <mongodb-pod-name> -n <NAMESPACE>; kubectl get svc mongodb-geo -n <NAMESPACE> -o yaml; kubectl logs <mongodb-pod-name> -n <NAMESPACE> --tail=200.\n",
       "4. Inspect geo Deployment/ConfigMap to find how DB connection is configured: kubectl get deployment geo -n <NAMESPACE> -o yaml; kubectl get configmap -n <NAMESPACE> | grep -i geo.\n",
       "5. Create or verify Kubernetes Secret for MongoDB credentials (do NOT store creds in ConfigMap): kubectl create secret generic mongodb-geo-creds --from-literal=MONGO_USER='<user>' --from-literal=MONGO_PASSWORD='<pass>' -n <NAMESPACE> OR --from-literal=MONGO_URI='mongodb://<user>:<pass>@mongodb-geo:27017/<db>?authSource=admin'.\n",
       "6. Update geo deployment to use correct MongoDB host/port and inject credentials from the Secret: set MONGO_HOST=mongodb-geo and MONGO_PORT=27017 or set MONGO_URI via secretKeyRef in deployment env (kubectl edit deployment geo -n <NAMESPACE> or use kubectl patch/set env).\n",
       "7. Perform a rolling restart to apply config/secret changes: kubectl rollout restart deployment/geo -n <NAMESPACE>; monitor rollout: kubectl rollout status deployment/geo -n <NAMESPACE>.\n",
       "8. Monitor new geo pods and logs for successful DB connection and absence of panic: kubectl get pods -l app=geo -n <NAMESPACE> -w; kubectl logs <new-geo-pod> -n <NAMESPACE> -c hotel-reserv-geo --follow.\n",
       "9. Test connectivity and credentials from a debug pod if needed: kubectl run --rm -it mongo-client --image=mongo --namespace=<NAMESPACE> -- bash then mongo --host mongodb-geo --port 27017 -u <user> -p '<pass>' --authenticationDatabase admin OR run nc from a pod to test TCP connectivity (nc -vz mongodb-geo 27017).\n",
       "10. Temporary workaround (only if you cannot change geo config quickly): add a short-lived service port mapping so mongodb-geo:27777 maps to targetPort 27017: kubectl patch svc mongodb-geo -n <NAMESPACE> --type='json' -p='[{\"op\":\"add\",\"path\":\"/spec/ports/-\",\"value\":{\"name\":\"mongo-alt\",\"port\":27777,\"targetPort\":27017,\"protocol\":\"TCP\"}}]'. Remove this mapping once geo is fixed.\n",
       "11. If authentication failures persist, verify/create the MongoDB user with appropriate roles using the mongo shell in the mongodb pod (follow your security process). Example: kubectl exec -it <mongodb-pod> -n <NAMESPACE> -- mongo admin -u <admin> -p '<admin-pass>' --eval \"db.getSiblingDB('<db>').createUser({user:'<user>',pwd:'<pass>',roles:[{role:'readWrite',db:'<db>'}]})\".\n",
       "12. If a change causes regressions, rollback geo: kubectl rollout undo deployment/geo -n <NAMESPACE>. Revert any temporary svc modifications by re-applying original service manifest or removing the temp port.\n",
       "13. Validate recovery: ensure geo pods are Running and Ready with no CrashLoopBackOff: kubectl get pods -n <NAMESPACE> | grep geo; verify readiness/liveness endpoints and application-level functionality.\n",
       "14. Post-incident remediation: move DB creds to Secrets (not ConfigMaps), restrict Secret RBAC, add CI/manifest checks for required DB env vars and secret usage, and harden geo startup (retries/backoff instead of panic on DB failure).\n",
       "15. Rotate credentials if they were exposed in logs or ConfigMaps during the incident and document the incident steps, root cause, remediation, and timeline in your incident tracker.\n"

A prior incident document retrieved from the incident store confirms MongoDB listens on the default 27017 and requires authentication.

Container is not Ready/Started -> recurring application startup failure persists.\\n- Pod geo-6b4b89b5f5-d74mv is effectively in CrashLoopBackOff despite Pod phase=Running: container hotel-reserv-geo has restartCount=15, last terminated with exitCode=2 at 2025-09-08T09:49:30Z and is currently Waiting with a 5m back-off; pod conditions show ContainersNotReady/Ready=False \\u2014 indicates a recurring application startup failure (process exiting with code 2).\\n- Application is panicking on startup due to a failed DB connection: logs show it reads DB URL mongodb-geo:27777, then errors with \\\"no reachable servers\\\" and panics \\u2014 this unreachable MongoDB is the likely root cause of the CrashLoopBackOff.\\n- Prometheus returned an empty vector for the restart-count query (sum(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total{namespace=\\\"test-hotel-reservation\\\"}) by (pod)), so we cannot verify pod restart counts from Prometheus \\u2014 indicates missing metrics/scraping, metric name/label mismatch, or data retention gap.\\n- A stored incident report was found in the incident store (via chroma_query_documents) that confirms the root cause: the geo service is attempting to connect to mongodb-geo:27777 while MongoDB listens on 27017 and runs with --auth, and it includes a ready mitigation playbook (correct port to 27017, inject credentials via Secret, or temporarily map service port 27777\\u219227017).\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udea8 Final Report (Root Cause)\\n> Diagnosis:\\nThe geo service (hotel-reserv-geo) is crashing on startup because it cannot connect to the MongoDB instance: the service is configured to connect to mongodb-geo:27777 while the MongoDB process is listening on 27017 and is running with authentication enabled. The failed DB connection ('no reachable servers') causes the application to panic and exit (ExitCode 2), producing repeated restarts and a CrashLoopBackOff.\\n\\nReasoning:\\nContainer status, restartCount, and events show repeated termination with ExitCode 2 and BackOff, indicating an application-level startup failure. Container logs explicitly show attempts to connect to 'mongodb-geo:27777' followed by 'no reachable servers' and a panic \\u2014 a clear indication the service cannot reach/authorize to the database. The incident document found in the incident store matches this symptom set and confirms the DB is actually listening on 27017 and requires authentication. Together these observations explain why the geo container cannot establish a DB connection and crashes on startup, producing the observed CrashLoopBackOff and ContainersNotReady state. The empty Prometheus restart metric suggests monitoring gaps but does not change the root cause identified from pod status and logs.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udee0\\ufe0f Mitigation Plan Strategy\\n\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udccb Detailed Mitigation Steps\\n\"]], \"uris\": null, \"included\": [\"documents\", \"metadatas\", \"distances\"], \"data\": null, \"metadatas\": [[null]], \"distances\": [[0.28135836124420166]]}\n",

(2) url-shorten-service ConfigMap shows client config for 'user-mention-service' pointing to host 'user-mention-service' port 9090 (so url-shorten-service targets the intended service). (3) user-mention-service Service and Deployment are correctly labeled and expose port 9090, and its Endpoints resolve to the user-mention-service pod (not back to url-shorten-service). These three unique checks rule out misconfigured client endpoints, ports, or service selectors causing routing back to the caller. Given the observed alternating sequence in traces, an inter-service retry/loop (incompatible retry/backoff or retry-on-same-error policies between clients) is the likely remaining cause; further confirmation requires traces/logs showing RPC error codes and client retry settings or examining service configs/code for retry policies."

(2) For compose requests that were processed, the downstream URL-shortening/user-mention interaction entered a mutual retry/amplification loop (trace shows alternating calls url-shorten-service -> user-mention-service -> url-shorten-service -> user-mention-service) due to incompatible retry semantics, which greatly increased end-to-end latency and contributed to the final error seen by nginx-thrift. nginx-thrift\u2019s very long proxy timeouts/keepalives allowed retries and slow requests to pile up, amplifying the symptom. In short: compose-post-side connection/accept failures triggered proxy-level retries/timeouts, and a concurrent retry-loop between url-shorten-service and user-mention-service amplified latency and led to the error observed at nginx-thrift.",

    "investigation_summary": "What was done and the major findings:\n- Priority #1 epicenter check (nginx-thrift): Verified nginx-thrift pod health, resource metrics, and nginx.conf timeouts. Correlated Jaeger trace showing the failure originated downstream. Conclusion: nginx-thrift was healthy and not the root cause; it exposed an upstream failure.\n- Priority #2 connection check (nginx-thrift <-> compose-post-service): Examined nginx logs and found repeated connection refused and socket timeouts targeting compose-post endpoints despite compose-post Service/pod being present and port mappings correct. Conclusion: compose-post was intermittently refusing/ failing to accept TCP connections; nginx long timeouts amplified symptoms.\n- Priority #3 connection check (url-shorten-service <-> user-mention-service): Validated Services, Deployments, Endpoints and client configs \u2014 routing was correct. The alternating sequence in the trace and correct wiring indicate incompatible retry semantics (mutual retry loop) as the most probable cause of repeated calls. Further app-level traces/logs or client retry-config inspection would fully confirm the retry-loop mechanics.\n- Cross-cutting insight: The observed end-to-end failure is a combination of an availability/accept problem on compose-post plus a cascading retry/amplification inside the compose-post request processing chain (url-shorten <-> user-mention). nginx-thrift timeouts configured very large allowed retries/timeouts to pile up and amplified the user-visible latency and errors.\nInvestigative coverage: Priority 1-3 tasks completed and provided converging evidence. Remaining lower-priority tasks (inspect compose-post pod internals, application logs, url-shorten/user-mention retry settings, cache/db health) would provide further confirmation and root-fix guidance but are not required to conclude the causal chain.",

Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\nYou are obligated to fill the field with \"the smallest set of tools required to accomplish the task\"\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

The agent instead describes network connection failures, proxy timeouts, and retry loops between completely different services (compose-post, url-shorten, user-mention, nginx-thrift). It targets the wrong components and a wholly unrelated failure mechanism, so this is a critical miss."

      "reasoning": "Evidence collected:\n- nginx-thrift ConfigMap/nginx.conf: nginx-thrift has fqdn_suffix configured and loads Lua clients, but the config does not show an explicit, correct external endpoint override (nginx.conf + init_by_lua show modules are required but endpoint resolution is done in Lua code).\n- compose-post-service Service: exists in namespace test-social-network with port 9090 (clusterIP 10.96.160.59) and selector service=compose-post-service.\n- compose-post-service Pod: a pod compose-post-service-7b495f794-98d7m is Running and its container exposes containerPort 9090 (podIP 10.244.1.14).\n- nginx-thrift logs: repeated errors from compose.lua (lines 62/65) showing \"connect() failed: Connection refused\" and Thrift TTransportException and \"lua tcp socket read timed out\" while handling /wrk2-api/post/compose requests. The logs show requests served by nginx (server: localhost) but the Thrift client fails to connect.\n\nConclusion: Because the backend service and pod are healthy and listening on 9090, and nginx-thrift is repeatedly getting connection-refused/timeouts, the most likely root cause is that nginx-thrift is calling the wrong host/port (e.g., connecting to localhost or otherwise mis-resolved address) rather than the compose-post-service ClusterDNS name:9090. Recommended next steps (outside this diagnosis): inspect the Lua client code (api/post/compose.lua) inside the nginx-thrift pod to confirm the exact host:port it uses (or exec into the pod and attempt a curl/telnet to compose-post-service:9090) and fix the endpoint to compose-post-service.test-social-network.svc.cluster.local:9090 or the service DNS name.",

                "reasoning": "Evidence collected:\n- nginx-thrift ConfigMap/nginx.conf: nginx-thrift has fqdn_suffix configured and loads Lua clients, but the config does not show an explicit, correct external endpoint override (nginx.conf + init_by_lua show modules are required but endpoint resolution is done in Lua code).\n- compose-post-service Service: exists in namespace test-social-network with port 9090 (clusterIP 10.96.160.59) and selector service=compose-post-service.\n- compose-post-service Pod: a pod compose-post-service-7b495f794-98d7m is Running and its container exposes containerPort 9090 (podIP 10.244.1.14).\n- nginx-thrift logs: repeated errors from compose.lua (lines 62/65) showing \"connect() failed: Connection refused\" and Thrift TTransportException and \"lua tcp socket read timed out\" while handling /wrk2-api/post/compose requests. The logs show requests served by nginx (server: localhost) but the Thrift client fails to connect.\n\nConclusion: Because the backend service and pod are healthy and listening on 9090, and nginx-thrift is repeatedly getting connection-refused/timeouts, the most likely root cause is that nginx-thrift is calling the wrong host/port (e.g., connecting to localhost or otherwise mis-resolved address) rather than the compose-post-service ClusterDNS name:9090. Recommended next steps (outside this diagnosis): inspect the Lua client code (api/post/compose.lua) inside the nginx-thrift pod to confirm the exact host:port it uses (or exec into the pod and attempt a curl/telnet to compose-post-service:9090) and fix the endpoint to compose-post-service.test-social-network.svc.cluster.local:9090 or the service DNS name."

When compose-post downstream connections were refused or slow, nginx-thrift worker threads blocked for many seconds (observed 28.47s Thrift client span), producing head-of-line blocking that amplified latency and surfaced errors. A contributing misconfiguration (likely in the Lua Thrift client) caused nginx-thrift to attempt connections to the wrong host/port (logs reference localhost while the compose-post-service is reachable at compose-post-service.test-social-network.svc.cluster.local:9090), producing repeated connection-refused/timeouts that further amplified blocking and triggered duplicate/repeated downstream invocations observed in traces.",

Priority-2 investigation (completed): validated compose-post-service Service and pod are healthy and listen on 9090; observed nginx-thrift logs referencing localhost and connection refused errors, leading to a likely host/port misconfiguration in the Lua Thrift client. Steps performed: kubectl get/describe for deployments, services, and pods; fetched ConfigMap and nginx.conf; retrieved nginx-thrift logs; retrieved Jaeger trace.

Your mission is to triage a Kubernetes application by analyzing the provided data.\n\nYour analysis must adhere to the following rules:\n1.  **Focus**: Identify symptoms at the **pod or service level only**. Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

Produce a concise, de-duplicated investigation plan where each task inspects a precise part of the infrastructure to surface the most likely root-cause signals and converge on the true RCA quickly.\n\n**Planning Rules**\n1. For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\nYou are obligated to fill the field with \"the smallest set of tools required to accomplish the task\"\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",
    "rca_agent": "You are an expert DevOps engineer performing focused Root Cause Analysis on a Kubernetes service.\n\nInstructions:\n1. You have full autonomy to select the necessary tools from the toolkit. Decide which tools are required to verify your hypotheses efficiently.\n2. For each tool call, first formulate a clear, testable hypothesis about a possible root cause that can be answered by the result. Avoid broad or exploratory queries.\n3. Each tool call must provide unique, non-overlapping information. Never repeat requests with similar parameters or investigate the same aspect repeatedly in slightly different ways.\n4. Stop investigating, even if you have not reached the budget limit, when you have:\n   - Clear evidence that directly identifies a root cause (or definitively rules one out)\n   - Multiple data points indicating the same failure/cause\n   - Sufficient information to answer the investigation goal\n5. DO NOT:\n   - Repeat or re-run tools unless you are testing a truly new and justified hypothesis\n   - Investigate unrelated resources or expand scope beyond the investigation goal\n6. When you have gathered sufficient, non-redundant evidence (typically after 2-3 targeted tool calls), call submit_final_diagnosis with:\n   - diagnosis: State the precise root cause as it pertains to the investigation goal\n   - reasoning: Support your diagnosis by referencing unique findings from your tool calls\n\nREMEMBER: Quality over quantity.

Identify patterns and correlations across findings\n2. Determine the primary root cause\n3. List all affected resources\n4. Summarize key evidence\n\n**Understanding Task Priority:**\nEach RCA investigation task has been assigned a priority level:\n- Priority 1 = Most important / Most likely to reveal root cause (investigated first)\n- Priority 2, 3, ... = Progressively lower importance\n- Tasks with lower priority numbers should generally have higher weight in your analysis\n- The priority reflects the likelihood that investigating that task/resource would uncover the root cause\n\nUse the priority information to contextualize findings: results from priority 1 tasks are typically more significant for determining root cause than lower priority investigations.\n\n**Detection & Localization Requirements:**\n- **detection**: Set to `true` if any problem/anomaly was detected in the cluster based on the evidence. Set to `false` only if no issues are found.\n- **localization**: Provide a list of ONLY the faulty/problematic components (service names or pod names) directly identified as the root cause. This should be a minimal, precise list - extract ONLY the specific resource(s) that caused the incident, not all affected resources.\n  - Example: If a service \"user-service\" has a misconfiguration causing downstream failures, localization = [\"user-service\"]\n  - Example: If a pod \"database-pod-xyz\" is failing, localization = [\"database-pod-xyz\"]\n  - Leave empty/null if the root cause cannot be localized to a specific service or pod.\n\n**Root Cause Expectations:**\n- Build a causal chain that connects symptoms, investigation evidence, and the precise failure mechanism\n- Cite concrete configuration or runtime details (e.g., \"service expects port 5432 but database listens on 5433\") when diagnosing misconfigurations or integration issues\n- If evidence stops at the symptom level, identify the missing proof and pursue it before finalizing\n\n**Strict Iteration Policy:**\nOnly request another RCA iteration when the existing evidence is insufficient to produce a confident final diagnosis. Never re-run or re-request tasks already marked as completed or currently in progress. When additional work is unavoidable, list only the minimal set of pending task priorities in `tasks_to_be_executed` and clearly justify why each is required. If the current findings support a solid root cause, leave `tasks_to_be_executed` empty and finalize the report.\n\nWhen you need more evidence, ask for the most targeted pending tasks that can close the causal gap (for example, verifying port mappings, credentials, or configuration values at both ends of a failing connection).\n\nProvide a clear, specific root cause statement that explains what caused the incident and why it happened now."

Many traces show repeated invocations of downstream services (url-shorten, user-mention, text), consistent with retry behavior. 2) compose-post-service logs: repeated Thrift client errors recorded across the interval (~08:38:11\u201308:38:37): \"TSocket::open() connect() <Host: post-storage-service Port: 9090>: Connection refused\" and \"(ClientPool.h:114:Pop) Failed to connect post-storage-client\". These logs directly show connection refused to post-storage-service on port 9090 and repeated connection attempts. 3) Routing/config check: nginx-thrift -> compose-post-service routing and compose-post-service Service/Endpoints are configured correctly (ClusterIP port 9090, endpoint 10.244.1.30:9090). No misconfigured nginx upstream was found, reducing likelihood of routing/misconfiguration as the cause.",

Findings: - Priority #1: Compose-post-service traces and logs were analyzed. All examined compose-post-service traces had has_error=true and trace sequences included many downstream calls. Compose-post-service pod logs contained repeated, time-correlated Thrift connection refusals to post-storage-service and client-pool failures. This establishes a direct failure path: post-storage-service refusing connections -> compose-post-service Thrift client errors and retries -> compose-post-service returns errors (has_error) and retries downstream subcalls, producing repeated downstream service appearances in traces. - Priority #2: nginx-thrift configuration and compose-post-service Service/Endpoints were inspected and found correctly configured (nginx uses DNS-based fqdn_suffix; no static/hard-coded wrong upstream; compose-post-service Service exposes port 9090 and a ready endpoint). This rules out gateway misrouting as the cause. Synthesis and causal chain: post-storage-service became unavailable or stopped accepting connections on port 9090, causing compose-post-service Thrift client to receive connection refused errors, fail the write path, and surface errors for compose flows. The compose-post-service error handling/retry logic then produced repeated downstream RPC invocations visible in traces (url-shorten, user-mention, text, etc.), and the gateway (nginx-thrift) surfaced these as erroring compose-post flows. Missing / limited data: we do not yet have post-storage-service pod logs or events to explain why it refused connections (process crash, OOM, port misbind, network policy, or node-level issue). However, the connection-refused messages in compose-post-service logs are concrete evidence that post-storage-service was the immediate failing component.",

Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

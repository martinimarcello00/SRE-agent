All these traces have has_error=true. 2) compose-post-service logs contain many repeated Thrift client connection failures: 'TSocket::open() connect() <Host: post-storage-service Port: 9090>: Connection refused' and repeated '[ClientPool.h:114:Pop] Failed to connect post-storage-client' entries at sub-second intervals, showing aggressive retry behavior toward post-storage-service. 3) kubectl_describe(Service text-service) shows the Service exposes only a numeric port 9090 with no port name; compose-post's configured downstream dependencies include text-service, suggesting a port/port-name mismatch that can cause partial RPC failures. 4) Traces also show repeated alternation among text-service, url-shorten-service and user-mention-service consistent with caller-side retries or duplicated invocations.",
    "investigation_summary": "Priority weighting and actions: Priority #1 investigation (completed) focused on the epicenter and confirmed compose-post-service as the source of reentrant RPC loops by correlating traces and compose-post logs (repeated self-appearance in traces plus repeated Thrift connection refused and client-pool failures). Priority #2 investigation (completed) performed two-sided checks for compose-post -> text-service and found a Service port naming mismatch: text-service exposes only an unnamed numeric port 9090 while compose-post declares text-service as a dependency (likely expecting a named Thrift port). Additional planned tasks (priorities 3-8) targeted deeper two-sided checks for user-service, url-shorten, caches and DBs; these produced supporting hypotheses (e.g., url-shorten and text-service interactions) but were not required to localize the epicenter. Overall conclusion: the incident was caused primarily by compose-post-service misrouting/service-discovery misconfiguration that led to re-entrant RPC loops, amplified by aggressive retry behavior against an unreachable post-storage-service. The unnamed port on text-service is a contributing configuration issue that increased failure rates and retries.",

Your mission is to triage a Kubernetes application by analyzing the provided data.\n\nYour analysis must adhere to the following rules:\n1.  **Focus**: Identify symptoms at the **pod or service level only**. Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

Set to `false` only if no issues are found.\n- **localization**: Provide a list of ONLY the faulty/problematic components (service names or pod names) directly identified as the root cause.

Never re-run or re-request tasks already marked as completed or currently in progress. When additional work is unavoidable, list only the minimal set of pending task priorities in `tasks_to_be_executed` and clearly justify why each is required. If the current findings support a solid root cause, leave `tasks_to_be_executed` empty and finalize the report.\n\nWhen you need more evidence, ask for the most targeted pending tasks that can close the causal gap (for example, verifying port mappings, credentials, or configuration values at both ends of a failing connection).\n\nProvide a clear, specific root cause statement that explains what caused the incident and why it happened now."

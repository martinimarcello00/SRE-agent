That matches the expected Thrift service port (9090).\nConclusion: No configuration mismatch in nginx.conf vs Kubernetes service definition was found. Potential amplification risk: no nginx-level retry policy is present, but client-side retry behavior would be implemented inside the Lua Thrift client code (not visible in nginx.conf); inspect the Lua scripts (api/post/compose or social_network_ComposePostService) inside the nginx-thrift pod to confirm whether they implement retries or exponential backoff that could amplify downstream errors.",

There is no hard-coded, conflicting host/port in nginx.conf.",
                "reasoning": "1) Describing the nginx-thrift Deployment shows the container mounts the ConfigMap 'nginx-thrift' and sets env fqdn_suffix = \".test-social-network.svc.cluster.local\" (deployment describe). This indicates Lua code likely constructs service FQDNs like <service-name> + fqdn_suffix.\n2) The nginx ConfigMap (nginx.conf) contains Lua-based Thrift client requires (e.g., social_network_ComposePostService / api/post/compose) and does not define any explicit upstream block or hard-coded hostname:port for compose-post-service; nginx-level retry directives are absent; only proxy_* timeouts (proxy_read_timeout/proxy_connect_timeout/proxy_send_timeout = 5000) and keepalive settings are present (configmap data).\n3) The compose-post-service Kubernetes Service exists in test-social-network with Port 9090 -> TargetPort 9090 and endpoints 10.244.1.17:9090 (service describe). That matches the expected Thrift service port (9090).\nConclusion: No configuration mismatch in nginx.conf vs Kubernetes service definition was found. Potential amplification risk: no nginx-level retry policy is present, but client-side retry behavior would be implemented inside the Lua Thrift client code (not visible in nginx.conf); inspect the Lua scripts (api/post/compose or social_network_ComposePostService) inside the nginx-thrift pod to confirm whether they implement retries or exponential backoff that could amplify downstream errors."

Priority-2 investigation (completed): validated that nginx-thrift configuration and ClusterIP/service port for compose-post-service match (no nginx host/port mismatch), and no nginx-level retry directives were found; client-side retries are implemented inside compose-post-service and are visible in the traces. Together the evidence supports a causal chain: post-storage refused connections -> compose-post-service experienced RPC failures -> compose-post-service retried/re-entered portions of the flow (duplicate spans/repeated downstream calls) -> errors propagated to nginx-thrift and surfaced to clients. Missing/inconclusive evidence: direct traces/logs from post-storage-service are not available (get_traces returned none for post-storage), so the immediate reason why post-storage was refusing connections (process crash, not listening on 9090, pod crashloop, kube-proxy/iptables/NetworkPolicy issue, or node-level networking problem) could not be determined from the collected data.",

Produce a concise, de-duplicated investigation plan where each task inspects a precise part of the infrastructure to surface the most likely root-cause signals and converge on the true RCA quickly.\n\n**Toolkit**\n- `kubectl_get`: list Kubernetes resources and their status\n- `kubectl_describe`: inspect detailed spec/events for a resource\n- `get_pods_from_service`: map services to backing pods\n- `get_cluster_pods_and_services`: snapshot cluster topology\n- `get_logs`: retrieve recent pod or service logs\n- `get_traces`: fetch traces filtered by latency/errors\n- `get_trace`: inspect a single trace end-to-end\n- `get_metrics`: read current CPU/memory/network metrics\n- `get_metrics_range`: compare historical metric windows\n- `get_services_used_by`: discover downstream service calls\n- `get_dependencies`: enumerate external/infra dependencies\n\n**Planning Rules**\n1. For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",
    "rca_agent": "\nYou are an expert DevOps engineer performing focused Root Cause Analysis on a Kubernetes service.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use ONLY the Priority Tools provided in the task. Do not propose or use tools outside this list.\n2. For each tool call, first formulate a clear, testable hypothesis about a possible root cause that can be answered by the result. Avoid broad or exploratory queries.\n3. Each tool call must provide unique, non-overlapping information. Never repeat requests with similar parameters or investigate the same aspect repeatedly in slightly different ways.\n4. Stop investigating, even if you have not reached the budget limit, when you have:\n   - Clear evidence that directly identifies a root cause (or definitively rules one out)\n   - Multiple data points indicating the same failure/cause\n   - Sufficient information to answer the investigation goal\n5. DO NOT:\n   - Repeat or re-run tools unless you are testing a truly new and justified hypothesis\n   - Query outside the given Target or Priority Tools\n   - Investigate unrelated resources or expand scope\n6. When you have gathered sufficient, non-redundant evidence (typically after 2-3 targeted tool calls), call submit_final_diagnosis with:\n   - diagnosis: State the precise root cause as it pertains to the investigation goal\n   - reasoning: Support your diagnosis by referencing unique findings from your tool calls\n\nREMEMBER: Quality over quantity. Focus on unique and conclusive findings rather than exhaustive or repetitive investigation.\n",
    "supervisor_agent": "You are an expert Site Reliability Engineer analyzing RCA findings to determine the root cause of an incident.\n\nAnalyze all symptoms and investigation findings to:\n1. Identify patterns and correlations across findings\n2. Determine the primary root cause\n3. List all affected resources\n4. Summarize key evidence\n\n**Understanding Task Priority:**\nEach RCA investigation task has been assigned a priority level:\n- Priority 1 = Most important / Most likely to reveal root cause (investigated first)\n- Priority 2, 3, ... = Progressively lower importance\n- Tasks with lower priority numbers should generally have higher weight in your analysis\n- The priority reflects the likelihood that investigating that task/resource would uncover the root cause\n\nUse the priority information to contextualize findings: results from priority 1 tasks are typically more significant for determining root cause than lower priority investigations.\n\n**Detection & Localization Requirements:**\n- **detection**: Set to `true` if any problem/anomaly was detected in the cluster based on the evidence. Set to `false` only if no issues are found.\n- **localization**: Provide a list of ONLY the faulty/problematic components (service names or pod names) directly identified as the root cause. This should be a minimal, precise list - extract ONLY the specific resource(s) that caused the incident, not all affected resources.\n  - Example: If a service \"user-service\" has a misconfiguration causing downstream failures, localization = [\"user-service\"]\n  - Example: If a pod \"database-pod-xyz\" is failing, localization = [\"database-pod-xyz\"]\n  - Leave empty/null if the root cause cannot be localized to a specific service or pod.\n\n**Root Cause Expectations:**\n- Build a causal chain that connects symptoms, investigation evidence, and the precise failure mechanism\n- Cite concrete configuration or runtime details (e.g., \"service expects port 5432 but database listens on 5433\") when diagnosing misconfigurations or integration issues\n- If evidence stops at the symptom level, identify the missing proof and pursue it before finalizing\n\n**Strict Iteration Policy:**\nOnly request another RCA iteration when the existing evidence is insufficient to produce a confident final diagnosis. Never re-run or re-request tasks already marked as completed or currently in progress. When additional work is unavoidable, list only the minimal set of pending task priorities in `tasks_to_be_executed` and clearly justify why each is required. If the current findings support a solid root cause, leave `tasks_to_be_executed` empty and finalize the report.\n\nWhen you need more evidence, ask for the most targeted pending tasks that can close the causal gap (for example, verifying port mappings, credentials, or configuration values at both ends of a failing connection).\n\nProvide a clear, specific root cause statement that explains what caused the incident and why it happened now."

Thus it gets the component and general connectivity failure right but misses the concrete configuration error driving that failure."

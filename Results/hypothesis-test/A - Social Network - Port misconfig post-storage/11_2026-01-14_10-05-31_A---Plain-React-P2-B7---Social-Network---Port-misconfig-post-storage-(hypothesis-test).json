This incorrect downstream target/protocol causes nginx to mark requests as errors at the ingress level.

Tracing showed nginx-thrift was the origin of error traces and a specific trace revealed nginx was proxying to an HTTP address (10.96.49.230:8080) that returned 500. Correlating this with get_services_used_by confirmed nginx intends to call compose-post-service. Priority-2 checked the Kubernetes service for compose-post-service and confirmed it exists and listens on 9090 with endpoints at 10.244.1.30:9090 \u2014 showing the observed nginx proxy target (10.96.49.230:8080) does not match the compose-post-service ClusterIP/port. Lower-priority hypotheses (misconfigured downstreams between compose-post-service and text/url/user-mention, or infra issues in url-shorten databases) remain possible contributors to the retry behaviour but the primary, root misconfiguration that explains the ingress-level 500s and error-originating traces is nginx-thrift's incorrect downstream mapping/protocol for the compose-post path. The investigation executed the recommended tracing and kube-service inspection tools and produced consistent, actionable evidence pointing to nginx-thrift misrouting.",

Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

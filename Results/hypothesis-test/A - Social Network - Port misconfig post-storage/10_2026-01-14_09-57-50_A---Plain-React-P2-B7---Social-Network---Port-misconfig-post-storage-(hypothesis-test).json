The pod has no env overrides and uses a mounted service-config.json (from a ConfigMap) that does not expose retry/backoff settings; the ConfigMap also contains a self-referential \"compose-post-service\" entry (possible source of recursion if code selects the wrong endpoint).",

Connection refused\" and repeated \"(ClientPool.h:114:Pop) Failed to connect post-storage-client\" messages \u2014 shows aggressive, immediate retries (no observable backoff) and an error storm of outbound RPCs.\n3) kubectl_describe configmap (compose-post-service): service-config.json contains endpoint entries (including post-storage-service -> post-storage-service:9090) and timeout_ms values but contains no retry/backoff configuration; it also includes a \"compose-post-service\" entry pointing to itself which could enable recursion if the application uses the wrong key.\nTogether these show the pod is (a) repeatedly attempting the same outbound RPCs (evidence from logs) and (b) configured from a ConfigMap that does not set retry/backoff parameters and includes a self-referential endpoint (potential misconfiguration). The most direct root cause is an application bug or misconfiguration in compose-post-service causing tight (non-backoff) retries to post-storage-service, leading to duplicated/recursive RPC attempts and error returns."

This tight retry loop generated an error storm and produced duplicated/recursive RPC traces (compose-post-service appearing at both the start and end of traces). The compose-post ConfigMap also lacks retry/backoff settings and contains a self-referential endpoint entry which is a likely contributing misconfiguration (could allow mis-selection of endpoints and recursion), but the primary failure mechanism is the pod's tight retry behavior against an unavailable post-storage-service.",

Your mission is to triage a Kubernetes application by analyzing the provided data.\n\nYour analysis must adhere to the following rules:\n1.  **Focus**: Identify symptoms at the **pod or service level only**. Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",
    "planner_agent": "\nYou are an expert Site Reliability Engineer. Produce a concise, de-duplicated investigation plan where each task inspects a precise part of the infrastructure to surface the most likely root-cause signals and converge on the true RCA quickly.\n\n**Toolkit**\n- `kubectl_get`: list Kubernetes resources and their status\n- `kubectl_describe`: inspect detailed spec/events for a resource\n- `get_pods_from_service`: map services to backing pods\n- `get_cluster_pods_and_services`: snapshot cluster topology\n- `get_logs`: retrieve recent pod or service logs\n- `get_traces`: fetch traces filtered by latency/errors\n- `get_trace`: inspect a single trace end-to-end\n- `get_metrics`: read current CPU/memory/network metrics\n- `get_metrics_range`: compare historical metric windows\n- `get_services_used_by`: discover downstream service calls\n- `get_dependencies`: enumerate external/infra dependencies\n\n**Planning Rules**\n1. For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",
    "rca_agent": "\nYou are an expert DevOps engineer performing focused Root Cause Analysis on a Kubernetes service.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use ONLY the Priority Tools provided in the task. Do not propose or use tools outside this list.\n2. For each tool call, first formulate a clear, testable hypothesis about a possible root cause that can be answered by the result. Avoid broad or exploratory queries.\n3. Each tool call must provide unique, non-overlapping information. Never repeat requests with similar parameters or investigate the same aspect repeatedly in slightly different ways.\n4. Stop investigating, even if you have not reached the budget limit, when you have:\n   - Clear evidence that directly identifies a root cause (or definitively rules one out)\n   - Multiple data points indicating the same failure/cause\n   - Sufficient information to answer the investigation goal\n5. DO NOT:\n   - Repeat or re-run tools unless you are testing a truly new and justified hypothesis\n   - Query outside the given Target or Priority Tools\n   - Investigate unrelated resources or expand scope\n6. When you have gathered sufficient, non-redundant evidence (typically after 2-3 targeted tool calls), call submit_final_diagnosis with:\n   - diagnosis: State the precise root cause as it pertains to the investigation goal\n   - reasoning: Support your diagnosis by referencing unique findings from your tool calls\n\nREMEMBER: Quality over quantity.

Identify patterns and correlations across findings\n2. Determine the primary root cause\n3. List all affected resources\n4. Summarize key evidence\n\n**Understanding Task Priority:**\nEach RCA investigation task has been assigned a priority level:\n- Priority 1 = Most important / Most likely to reveal root cause (investigated first)\n- Priority 2, 3, ... = Progressively lower importance\n- Tasks with lower priority numbers should generally have higher weight in your analysis\n- The priority reflects the likelihood that investigating that task/resource would uncover the root cause\n\nUse the priority information to contextualize findings: results from priority 1 tasks are typically more significant for determining root cause than lower priority investigations.\n\n**Detection & Localization Requirements:**\n- **detection**: Set to `true` if any problem/anomaly was detected in the cluster based on the evidence. Set to `false` only if no issues are found.\n- **localization**: Provide a list of ONLY the faulty/problematic components (service names or pod names) directly identified as the root cause.

Never re-run or re-request tasks already marked as completed or currently in progress. When additional work is unavoidable, list only the minimal set of pending task priorities in `tasks_to_be_executed` and clearly justify why each is required. If the current findings support a solid root cause, leave `tasks_to_be_executed` empty and finalize the report.\n\nWhen you need more evidence, ask for the most targeted pending tasks that can close the causal gap (for example, verifying port mappings, credentials, or configuration values at both ends of a failing connection).\n\nProvide a clear, specific root cause statement that explains what caused the incident and why it happened now."

Therefore, from the provided describes we can confirm the service is listening on 9090 and reachable, but we cannot verify that nginx-thrift is configured to call compose-post-service (host/port/name) or what timeouts/retries it uses without inspecting the nginx-thrift ConfigMap (nginx.conf).",

This shows the Thrift call configuration is stored in the mounted nginx.conf, not as deployment env fields.\n- From kubectl describe service compose-post-service: Service Type=ClusterIP with Port=9090, TargetPort=9090 and Endpoints=10.244.1.30:9090. This proves the compose-post-service is available on port 9090.\nConclusion: service-side mapping (port/targetPort/endpoints) matches the expected 9090, but nginx-thrift's configured Thrift endpoint and timeout/retry settings cannot be verified from the deployment describe because they reside in the mounted ConfigMap. To complete verification, inspect the nginx-thrift ConfigMap (nginx.conf) to confirm the exact Thrift endpoint (service name or IP), port, and any timeout/retry policies nginx-thrift uses.",

Therefore, from the provided describes we can confirm the service is listening on 9090 and reachable, but we cannot verify that nginx-thrift is configured to call compose-post-service (host/port/name) or what timeouts/retries it uses without inspecting the nginx-thrift ConfigMap (nginx.conf).",

This shows the Thrift call configuration is stored in the mounted nginx.conf, not as deployment env fields.\n- From kubectl describe service compose-post-service: Service Type=ClusterIP with Port=9090, TargetPort=9090 and Endpoints=10.244.1.30:9090. This proves the compose-post-service is available on port 9090.\nConclusion: service-side mapping (port/targetPort/endpoints) matches the expected 9090, but nginx-thrift's configured Thrift endpoint and timeout/retry settings cannot be verified from the deployment describe because they reside in the mounted ConfigMap. To complete verification, inspect the nginx-thrift ConfigMap (nginx.conf) to confirm the exact Thrift endpoint (service name or IP), port, and any timeout/retry policies nginx-thrift uses."

The tight-loop retries from compose-post-service produced rapid, duplicate downstream RPC attempts (amplifying traffic and producing repeated child-call patterns observed in traces), which led to error spans being set at the top-level nginx-thrift and exposed alternating/duplicated calls between user-mention-service and url-shorten-service in the traces. In short: post-storage-service refusal triggered, but the incident was driven/amplified by a bug in compose-post-service retry/client-pool behavior which caused the observed duplicated downstream calls and top-level errors.",

Connection refused\" and repeated \"(ClientPool.h:114:Pop) Failed to connect post-storage-client\" entries (hundreds within seconds). 3) kubectl describes confirm compose-post-service is exposed on port 9090 (ClusterIP 10.96.101.87:9090 -> endpoint 10.244.1.30:9090), and nginx-thrift's Thrift client config is supplied via a mounted nginx.conf ConfigMap (not visible in pod env), so top-level call configuration is stored in ConfigMap.

Tracing showed compose-post-service as the first downstream from nginx-thrift in all error traces and displayed repeated child-call patterns (duplicate/alternating downstream invocations). Combining logs and traces led to the diagnosis that compose-post-service's retry/client-pool logic is aggressively retrying (tight-loop) on connection refusal, generating duplicated downstream calls and producing the observed trace-level alternating calls between user-mention-service and url-shorten-service. Priority-2 connection checks (completed): compose-post-service is reachable on 9090 per Service describe; nginx-thrift config is in a mounted ConfigMap (nginx.conf) and should be inspected if needed for additional details about timeouts/retries. Lower-priority tasks that inspect other compose-post downstream client configs and url-shorten/user-mention infra were planned but are not required to establish the primary causal chain.

Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

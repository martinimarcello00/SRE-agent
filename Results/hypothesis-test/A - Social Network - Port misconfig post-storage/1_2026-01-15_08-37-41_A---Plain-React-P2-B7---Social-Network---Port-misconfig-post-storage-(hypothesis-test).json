The compose-post pod entered an aggressive Thrift client retry loop (seconds-level attempts), producing repeated outbound calls and re-entrant call behavior observed in traces. Both problems together caused user-facing failures: nginx could not reach the expected compose-post endpoint, and compose-post itself was amplifying errors via aggressive retries against a refusing post-storage-service.",

Findings: (a) compose-post-service pod is actively retrying to post-storage-service:9090 because post-storage-service refused TCP connections; these retries are frequent enough to produce repeated downstream invocations observed in traces. (b) nginx-thrift was misconfigured via its mounted ConfigMap and was attempting to route requests to 10.96.235.85:8080 instead of compose-post-service:9090, causing ingress connection refused errors. Correlation: nginx misrouting explains the gateway-level failures; compose-post's retry loop explains the repeated hops/duplicate calls and error amplification within the microservice chain. Tracing gaps prevented capture of the full retry spans, but logs from involved pods provide direct evidence. Remaining pending tasks (connection checks to other downstream services, trace-level analysis, pod metrics) would add useful detail but are not required to conclude the root causes.",

Your mission is to triage a Kubernetes application by analyzing the provided data.\n\nYour analysis must adhere to the following rules:\n1.  **Focus**: Identify symptoms at the **pod or service level only**. Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

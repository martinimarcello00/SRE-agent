Priority 2 investigation (completed) inspected pod environment and memcached service: the rate container has no memcached host/port env vars even though memcached-rate is available, revealing a separate configuration gap. Lower-priority connection checks to MongoDB and backing pod health were planned but not required because the logs provide a definitive failure mode. Conclusion: the direct root cause is the authentication failure and the application's panic on that failure; remediation should first verify and restore correct DB credentials or DB-side user state, and change the application to handle authentication failures more gracefully (retry, exponential backoff, clear error logging) and to include correct memcached configuration and readiness/liveness probes to avoid uncontrolled crash loops.",

Your mission is to triage a Kubernetes application by analyzing the provided data.\n\nYour analysis must adhere to the following rules:\n1.  **Focus**: Identify symptoms at the **pod or service level only**. Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

Never repeat requests with similar parameters or investigate the same aspect repeatedly in slightly different ways.\n4. Stop investigating, even if you have not reached the budget limit, when you have:\n   - Clear evidence that directly identifies a root cause (or definitively rules one out)\n   - Multiple data points indicating the same failure/cause\n   - Sufficient information to answer the investigation goal\n5.

Kubernetes restarts the process repeatedly, producing CrashLoopBackOff. The immediate reason is bad/missing MongoDB credentials or a mismatched authentication mechanism (e.g., secret not mounted, wrong username/password, or client/server auth mech mismatch) used by the rate container when connecting to mongodb-rate. This explains why the container began failing now (credential/secret/config changed or was not provided to this pod).",

This provides a direct causal chain from failed DB auth -> application panic -> container exit (code 2) -> CrashLoopBackOff. Priority #2 investigation observed missing memcached configuration in the pod spec (no MEMCACHED_* env vars) while the memcached-rate Service exists and is healthy; however, there is no application log evidence that missing memcached configuration triggers the immediate crash. Lower-priority checks of MongoDB and memcached pod health were planned but not required to conclude the root cause because the DB auth failure is explicitly logged. Recommended remediation: verify and correct the MongoDB credentials/config provided to the rate deployment (ensure the secret is present and mounted, environment variables/connection string include correct user/password and authMechanism matches the DB), then redeploy the rate pods. If credentials are correct, check for recent secret/config changes or MongoDB user status (locked/expired) on pod mongodb-rate-56cc8659c9-vfqpl.",

Your mission is to triage a Kubernetes application by analyzing the provided data.\n\nYour analysis must adhere to the following rules:\n1.  **Focus**: Identify symptoms at the **pod or service level only**. Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

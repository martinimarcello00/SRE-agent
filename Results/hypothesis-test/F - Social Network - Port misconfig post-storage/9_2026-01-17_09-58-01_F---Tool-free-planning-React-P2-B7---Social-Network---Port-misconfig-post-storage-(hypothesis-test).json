The service repeatedly fails to connect to post-storage-service (TSocket connection refused), causing Thrift client errors that are logged; there is no evidence in the pod spec or mounted service-config.json of an interceptor or config flag that would normalize/strip exception messages, and the pod has no environment vars or sidecars indicating an error-mapping change. The empty error_message observed at nginx-thrift is therefore explained by downstream connection failures (connection-refused Thrift errors) rather than an application-level exception-mapping change in compose-post-service.",
                "reasoning": "1) compose-post-service logs contain hundreds of Thrift client errors showing TSocket::open() connect() <Host: post-storage-service Port: 9090>: Connection refused and repeated \"Failed to connect post-storage-client\" errors \u2014 direct evidence the pod cannot reach post-storage-service (logs retrieved via get_logs). 2) Pod description shows the container runs image deathstarbench/social-network-microservices:latest with no environment variables and only the compose-post-service ConfigMap mounted; no sidecars present (kubectl_describe). 3) The mounted service-config.json (from ConfigMap compose-post-service) contains only service connection settings and no flags for exception normalization or Thrift interceptor configuration (kubectl_get configmap). Together these indicate the empty/normalized error seen upstream is caused by downstream connection failures (and possibly the Thrift client producing error responses with empty message on connection failure), not by compose-post-service intentionally swallowing/normalizing exception details."

The compose-post Kubernetes Service (compose-post-service:9090) and Endpoints point to a running pod at 10.244.1.36:9090, and the compose-post pod exposes container port 9090. nginx-thrift is configured via the nginx-thrift ConfigMap (nginx.conf) to call the compose post Lua client. The nginx-thrift logs show repeated \"connect() failed: Connection refused\" for compose_post RPCs, indicating TCP RST from the target, not DNS/hostname/port mismatch.",
      "reasoning": "Evidence:\n- Pods: nginx-thrift and compose-post pods are present and Running in namespace test-social-network (kubectl get pods). (call 1)\n- nginx-thrift pod mounts nginx.conf from ConfigMap nginx-thrift and lua clients are loaded there (kubectl describe pod). The nginx.conf references the post/compose lua client (content_by_lua -> api/post/compose). (call 2)\n- ConfigMap nginx-thrift contains nginx.conf with Lua client hooks for /api/post/compose (shows nginx is calling the compose client, not a wrong service name). (call 3)\n- Kubernetes Service compose-post-service exposes port 9090 and selector service=compose-post-service (kubectl get service). (call 4)\n- Endpoints for compose-post-service include address 10.244.1.36 with port 9090 (kubectl get endpoints). This matches service.port=9090 -> endpoint 10.244.1.36:9090. (call 5)\n- nginx-thrift logs show many \"connect() failed: Connection refused\" errors for ComposePost RPC attempts (kubectl logs). This is a TCP connection refusal from the target, not an unresolved hostname or mismatch in service name/port. (call 6)\n- The compose-post pod description shows the container exposes port 9090 and is Ready (kubectl describe pod). (call 7)\nConclusion: The observed failures are connection refusals from the compose-post endpoint despite the Service/Endpoints naming and ports matching. Therefore the root cause is not a misconfiguration of nginx-thrift pointing to the wrong service name/port; instead it\u2019s an application-level refusal at the compose-post endpoint (compose-post process not accepting connections or intermittently refusing TCP) or a runtime issue on the compose-post container. Next steps: check compose-post process logs and liveness/readiness probes, and from nginx-thrift exec -> attempt tcp/telnet to 10.244.1.36:9090 to reproduce the refusal.",

The nginx.conf references the post/compose lua client (content_by_lua -> api/post/compose). (call 2)\n- ConfigMap nginx-thrift contains nginx.conf with Lua client hooks for /api/post/compose (shows nginx is calling the compose client, not a wrong service name). (call 3)\n- Kubernetes Service compose-post-service exposes port 9090 and selector service=compose-post-service (kubectl get service). (call 4)\n- Endpoints for compose-post-service include address 10.244.1.36 with port 9090 (kubectl get endpoints). This matches service.port=9090 -> endpoint 10.244.1.36:9090. (call 5)\n- nginx-thrift logs show many \"connect() failed: Connection refused\" errors for ComposePost RPC attempts (kubectl logs). This is a TCP connection refusal from the target, not an unresolved hostname or mismatch in service name/port. (call 6)\n- The compose-post pod description shows the container exposes port 9090 and is Ready (kubectl describe pod). (call 7)\nConclusion: The observed failures are connection refusals from the compose-post endpoint despite the Service/Endpoints naming and ports matching. Therefore the root cause is not a misconfiguration of nginx-thrift pointing to the wrong service name/port; instead it\u2019s an application-level refusal at the compose-post endpoint (compose-post process not accepting connections or intermittently refusing TCP) or a runtime issue on the compose-post container. Next steps: check compose-post process logs and liveness/readiness probes, and from nginx-thrift exec -> attempt tcp/telnet to 10.244.1.36:9090 to reproduce the refusal."

Findings: (a) compose-post is logging repeated connection refused to post-storage-service (TSocket connect failures); (b) nginx-thrift sees TCP connection refusals talking to compose-post (connect() failed: Connection refused) even though Service/Endpoints and pod ports align; (c) there is no evidence compose-post is intentionally stripping exception messages. Conclusion: the incident stems from post-storage-service being unavailable (connection refused) which caused compose-post client errors and a degradation/refusal of incoming RPCs, leading to RPC failures with empty error messages at the gateway.

Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\nYou are obligated to fill the field with \"the smallest set of tools required to accomplish the task\"\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation.

DO NOT:\n   - Repeat or re-run tools unless you are testing a truly new and justified hypothesis\n   - Investigate unrelated resources or expand scope beyond the investigation goal\n6. When you have gathered sufficient, non-redundant evidence (typically after 2-3 targeted tool calls), call submit_final_diagnosis with:\n   - diagnosis: State the precise root cause as it pertains to the investigation goal\n   - reasoning: Support your diagnosis by referencing unique findings from your tool calls\n\nREMEMBER: Quality over quantity. Focus on unique and conclusive findings rather than exhaustive or repetitive investigation\n",
    "supervisor_agent": "You are an expert Site Reliability Engineer analyzing RCA findings to determine the root cause of an incident.\n\nAnalyze all symptoms and investigation findings to:\n1. Identify patterns and correlations across findings\n2. Determine the primary root cause\n3. List all affected resources\n4. Summarize key evidence\n\n**Understanding Task Priority:**\nEach RCA investigation task has been assigned a priority level:\n- Priority 1 = Most important / Most likely to reveal root cause (investigated first)\n- Priority 2, 3, ... = Progressively lower importance\n- Tasks with lower priority numbers should generally have higher weight in your analysis\n- The priority reflects the likelihood that investigating that task/resource would uncover the root cause\n\nUse the priority information to contextualize findings: results from priority 1 tasks are typically more significant for determining root cause than lower priority investigations.\n\n**Detection & Localization Requirements:**\n- **detection**: Set to `true` if any problem/anomaly was detected in the cluster based on the evidence. Set to `false` only if no issues are found.\n- **localization**: Provide a list of ONLY the faulty/problematic components (service names or pod names) directly identified as the root cause. This should be a minimal, precise list - extract ONLY the specific resource(s) that caused the incident, not all affected resources.\n  - Example: If a service \"user-service\" has a misconfiguration causing downstream failures, localization = [\"user-service\"]\n  - Example: If a pod \"database-pod-xyz\" is failing, localization = [\"database-pod-xyz\"]\n  - Leave empty/null if the root cause cannot be localized to a specific service or pod.\n\n**Root Cause Expectations:**\n- Build a causal chain that connects symptoms, investigation evidence, and the precise failure mechanism\n- Cite concrete configuration or runtime details (e.g., \"service expects port 5432 but database listens on 5433\") when diagnosing misconfigurations or integration issues\n- If evidence stops at the symptom level, identify the missing proof and pursue it before finalizing\n\n**Strict Iteration Policy:**\nOnly request another RCA iteration when the existing evidence is insufficient to produce a confident final diagnosis. Never re-run or re-request tasks already marked as completed or currently in progress. When additional work is unavoidable, list only the minimal set of pending task priorities in `tasks_to_be_executed` and clearly justify why each is required. If the current findings support a solid root cause, leave `tasks_to_be_executed` empty and finalize the report.\n\nWhen you need more evidence, ask for the most targeted pending tasks that can close the causal gap (for example, verifying port mappings, credentials, or configuration values at both ends of a failing connection).\n\nProvide a clear, specific root cause statement that explains what caused the incident and why it happened now."

However, it attributes the problem to generic unavailability/connection refusals and never identifies the specific mechanical root cause: the Service\u2019s targetPort is misconfigured (9999 vs app listening on 9090). Thus, it gets the component and symptom right but misses the exact configuration issue driving the failure."

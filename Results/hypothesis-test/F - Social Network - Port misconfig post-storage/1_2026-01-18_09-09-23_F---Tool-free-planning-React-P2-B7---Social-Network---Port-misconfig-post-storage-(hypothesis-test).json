Nginx-level timeouts are set to 5000 (proxy_read_timeout/proxy_connect_timeout/proxy_send_timeout); there are no nginx retry settings for the Thrift calls in the nginx.conf (retries would be handled in the lua Thrift client code if present).",
                "reasoning": "Evidence:\n1) Pod inspect: describe of test-social-network/nginx-thrift-7fbb6d9b65-vmxgb shows nginx.conf is mounted from ConfigMap 'nginx-thrift' (so the active nginx config is that ConfigMap).\n2) ConfigMap content (nginx-thrift) contains Lua initialization that requires social_network_ComposePostService and creates a ComposePostServiceClient; it also sets env fqdn_suffix='.test-social-network.svc.cluster.local' and global proxy timeouts proxy_read_timeout/proxy_connect_timeout/proxy_send_timeout = 5000. The nginx.conf does not contain an HTTP upstream with a hard-coded host:port for compose-post\u2014calls are performed via Lua Thrift client.\n3) Service: test-social-network/compose-post-service exists and exposes port 9090 (port: 9090, targetPort: 9090) with selector service=compose-post-service.\n4) Endpoints: test-social-network/compose-post-service Endpoints include address 10.244.1.26 with targetRef pod compose-post-service-7b495f794-vsp4p and port 9090. This matches the compose-post pod listed by the pod selector. \nConclusion: nginx-thrift -> compose-post routing is consistent: nginx's Lua Thrift client will resolve compose-post via cluster DNS (service name + fqdn_suffix) to compose-post-service.test-social-network.svc.cluster.local:9090, and the Kubernetes Service/Endpoints correctly expose the running pod at 10.244.1.26:9090. Nginx-level timeouts are 5000; retry behavior for Thrift is not configured in nginx.conf and would be in the Lua client code (not present in the ConfigMap)."

Priority 2 validated nginx-thrift -> compose-post routing and confirmed nginx's Lua Thrift client and Service/Endpoints for compose-post were configured correctly. Correlating these findings establishes a causal chain: nginx-thrift -> compose-post accepted the request, compose-post attempted outbound Thrift RPCs to post-storage-service but received TCP connection refused responses, triggering retries and ultimately surfacing errors back at nginx-thrift. No evidence was found that compose-post itself was unhealthy, so remediation should focus on post-storage-service availability (its listener, pod process, or network connectivity to port 9090).",

Your mission is to triage a Kubernetes application by analyzing the provided data.\n\nYour analysis must adhere to the following rules:\n1.  **Focus**: Identify symptoms at the **pod or service level only**. Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

Produce a concise, de-duplicated investigation plan where each task inspects a precise part of the infrastructure to surface the most likely root-cause signals and converge on the true RCA quickly.\n\n**Planning Rules**\n1. For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\nYou are obligated to fill the field with \"the smallest set of tools required to accomplish the task\"\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

You have full autonomy to select the necessary tools from the toolkit. Decide which tools are required to verify your hypotheses efficiently.\n2. For each tool call, first formulate a clear, testable hypothesis about a possible root cause that can be answered by the result. Avoid broad or exploratory queries.\n3. Each tool call must provide unique, non-overlapping information. Never repeat requests with similar parameters or investigate the same aspect repeatedly in slightly different ways.\n4. Stop investigating, even if you have not reached the budget limit, when you have:\n   - Clear evidence that directly identifies a root cause (or definitively rules one out)\n   - Multiple data points indicating the same failure/cause\n   - Sufficient information to answer the investigation goal\n5. DO NOT:\n   - Repeat or re-run tools unless you are testing a truly new and justified hypothesis\n   - Investigate unrelated resources or expand scope beyond the investigation goal\n6.

Set to `false` only if no issues are found.\n- **localization**: Provide a list of ONLY the faulty/problematic components (service names or pod names) directly identified as the root cause.

Never re-run or re-request tasks already marked as completed or currently in progress. When additional work is unavoidable, list only the minimal set of pending task priorities in `tasks_to_be_executed` and clearly justify why each is required.

The mounted jaeger-config.yml in the compose-post-service ConfigMap shows sampler.param: 0.01 (1% sampling), explaining the lack of traces for the failing requests. 3) Pod describe shows the container is Running and Restart Count: 0, so this is not an OOM/restart-induced state.

Pod was Running with no restarts.\n- Priority #2 (completed): Examined nginx-thrift config, compose-post Service spec and Endpoints. Confirmed Service and Endpoints exist for compose-post, nginx timeouts are large (not the cause), and nginx logs show immediate \"Connection refused\" errors when connecting to backends. Correlated that endpoints existed but TCP connect was actively refused.\nConclusion: The root cause is post-storage refusing TCP connections on 9090, causing compose-post to fail its Thrift calls and propagate empty/unspecified errors upstream.

Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\nYou are obligated to fill the field with \"the smallest set of tools required to accomplish the task\"\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",
    "rca_agent": "You are an expert DevOps engineer performing focused Root Cause Analysis on a Kubernetes service.\n\nInstructions:\n1. You have full autonomy to select the necessary tools from the toolkit. Decide which tools are required to verify your hypotheses efficiently.\n2. For each tool call, first formulate a clear, testable hypothesis about a possible root cause that can be answered by the result. Avoid broad or exploratory queries.\n3. Each tool call must provide unique, non-overlapping information. Never repeat requests with similar parameters or investigate the same aspect repeatedly in slightly different ways.\n4. Stop investigating, even if you have not reached the budget limit, when you have:\n   - Clear evidence that directly identifies a root cause (or definitively rules one out)\n   - Multiple data points indicating the same failure/cause\n   - Sufficient information to answer the investigation goal\n5. DO NOT:\n   - Repeat or re-run tools unless you are testing a truly new and justified hypothesis\n   - Investigate unrelated resources or expand scope beyond the investigation goal\n6. When you have gathered sufficient, non-redundant evidence (typically after 2-3 targeted tool calls), call submit_final_diagnosis with:\n   - diagnosis: State the precise root cause as it pertains to the investigation goal\n   - reasoning: Support your diagnosis by referencing unique findings from your tool calls\n\nREMEMBER: Quality over quantity. Focus on unique and conclusive findings rather than exhaustive or repetitive investigation\n",
    "supervisor_agent": "You are an expert Site Reliability Engineer analyzing RCA findings to determine the root cause of an incident.\n\nAnalyze all symptoms and investigation findings to:\n1. Identify patterns and correlations across findings\n2. Determine the primary root cause\n3. List all affected resources\n4. Summarize key evidence\n\n**Understanding Task Priority:**\nEach RCA investigation task has been assigned a priority level:\n- Priority 1 = Most important / Most likely to reveal root cause (investigated first)\n- Priority 2, 3, ... = Progressively lower importance\n- Tasks with lower priority numbers should generally have higher weight in your analysis\n- The priority reflects the likelihood that investigating that task/resource would uncover the root cause\n\nUse the priority information to contextualize findings: results from priority 1 tasks are typically more significant for determining root cause than lower priority investigations.\n\n**Detection & Localization Requirements:**\n- **detection**: Set to `true` if any problem/anomaly was detected in the cluster based on the evidence. Set to `false` only if no issues are found.\n- **localization**: Provide a list of ONLY the faulty/problematic components (service names or pod names) directly identified as the root cause. This should be a minimal, precise list - extract ONLY the specific resource(s) that caused the incident, not all affected resources.\n  - Example: If a service \"user-service\" has a misconfiguration causing downstream failures, localization = [\"user-service\"]\n  - Example: If a pod \"database-pod-xyz\" is failing, localization = [\"database-pod-xyz\"]\n  - Leave empty/null if the root cause cannot be localized to a specific service or pod.\n\n**Root Cause Expectations:**\n- Build a causal chain that connects symptoms, investigation evidence, and the precise failure mechanism\n- Cite concrete configuration or runtime details (e.g., \"service expects port 5432 but database listens on 5433\") when diagnosing misconfigurations or integration issues\n- If evidence stops at the symptom level, identify the missing proof and pursue it before finalizing\n\n**Strict Iteration Policy:**\nOnly request another RCA iteration when the existing evidence is insufficient to produce a confident final diagnosis. Never re-run or re-request tasks already marked as completed or currently in progress. When additional work is unavoidable, list only the minimal set of pending task priorities in `tasks_to_be_executed` and clearly justify why each is required. If the current findings support a solid root cause, leave `tasks_to_be_executed` empty and finalize the report.\n\nWhen you need more evidence, ask for the most targeted pending tasks that can close the causal gap (for example, verifying port mappings, credentials, or configuration values at both ends of a failing connection).\n\nProvide a clear, specific root cause statement that explains what caused the incident and why it happened now."

Thus it captures the immediate symptom but not the specific configuration error that caused it."

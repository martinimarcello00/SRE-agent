Root cause: Although endpoints/ports/timeouts are compatible, there is no end-to-end call flow \u2014 likely because (a) compose-post never reached the code path that calls url-shorten (compose-post logs show failures contacting post-storage-service), and/or (b) url-shorten was impaired by MongoDB failures at startup and may not have been able to process requests.

However there is no observed RPC traffic between them in the logs: compose-post logs show repeated connection attempts to post-storage-service but no Thrift calls to url-shorten; url-shorten logs show MongoDB connectivity/index errors during startup and then server start, but no incoming Thrift method traces or any outgoing calls to user-mention-service. Root cause: Although endpoints/ports/timeouts are compatible, there is no end-to-end call flow \u2014 likely because (a) compose-post never reached the code path that calls url-shorten (compose-post logs show failures contacting post-storage-service), and/or (b) url-shorten was impaired by MongoDB failures at startup and may not have been able to process requests. No evidence was found that compose-post is invoking url-shorten with flags/params that trigger url-shorten->user-mention callbacks.",
                "reasoning": "Evidence:\n- compose-post service-config.json (ConfigMap) contains \"url-shorten-service\": {\"addr\":\"url-shorten-service\",\"port\":9090,\"timeout_ms\":10000} \u2014 confirms compose-post is configured to call url-shorten at port 9090 with 10s timeout.\n- url-shorten Deployment and Service both expose port 9090 (Service clusterIP 10.96.2.116 port 9090) \u2014 confirms service-side port matches client config.\n- compose-post logs (recent) contain many Thrift TSocket::open() connection refused messages to post-storage-service and no log lines showing Thrift connections/methods targeting url-shorten \u2014 indicates compose-post did not visibly make/complete calls to url-shorten during the log window.\n- url-shorten logs show repeated MongoDB \"No suitable servers found... url-shorten-mongodb:27017\" errors during startup and then \"Starting the url-shorten-service server...\", but no logs of incoming RPC method names or outgoing calls to user-mention-service \u2014 indicates url-shorten was having DB issues and there is no trace evidence of it calling user-mention.\nConclusion actionable items (recommended):\n1) Fix url-shorten-mongodb connectivity so url-shorten can fully initialize and accept requests.\n2) Investigate compose-post upstream failures (post-storage connection refused) that may prevent it from reaching the URL-shortening code path; reproduce a successful compose-post flow while tailing both compose-post and url-shorten logs to capture the Thrift method names and any user-mention callbacks.\n3) If you need proof whether url-shorten triggers user-mention on certain flags, add request/trace logging or enable debug logging in url-shorten and/or capture an end-to-end trace via Jaeger. (Current logs provide no evidence of triggering user-mention callbacks.)"

      "reasoning": "Evidence collected:\n- Pod presence/health: get_pods_from_service showed a single pod (user-mention-service-59cf6d5b8f-gpcct) in Running state; kubectl_describe shows the container is Started, Ready=True, RestartCount=0 and no error events \u2014 no crash/restart symptom that would indicate unhandled exceptions.\n- Logs: get_logs (important=true) returned only startup info and no ERROR/WARN or stack traces for the pod, so no observed malformed Thrift error payloads or serialization exceptions in runtime logs.\n- Traces: get_traces (only_errors=true) returned no error traces for user-mention-service in the recent lookback, so there are no recorded RPC error traces to correlate to malformed Thrift payloads.\n- Dependencies/config: get_services_used_by returned an empty list (service uses 0 other services). The mounted service-config.json (from kubectl_get configmap) contains a generic url-shorten-service entry (shared config) but this alone does not indicate user-mention-service actually calls it. Combined with the empty dependency list, there is no evidence of unexpected callbacks to url-shorten-service.\n\nConclusion: With the available logs, traces, pod state, and dependency listing we found no support for the hypothesis. If this issue is intermittent or only occurs under specific load/inputs, next steps would be to reproduce with increased tracing/log level and capture logs around known failing traceIDs (if supplied) or enable RPC-level tracing for a longer window.",

The mounted service-config.json (from kubectl_get configmap) contains a generic url-shorten-service entry (shared config) but this alone does not indicate user-mention-service actually calls it. Combined with the empty dependency list, there is no evidence of unexpected callbacks to url-shorten-service.\n\nConclusion: With the available logs, traces, pod state, and dependency listing we found no support for the hypothesis. If this issue is intermittent or only occurs under specific load/inputs, next steps would be to reproduce with increased tracing/log level and capture logs around known failing traceIDs (if supplied) or enable RPC-level tracing for a longer window."

Under upstream failures (compose-post repeatedly observed 'Connection refused' to post-storage-service), compose-post produced dense immediate retries that amplified downstream failures. Concurrently, url-shorten-service was impaired by MongoDB connectivity/index creation failures at startup (serverSelectionTimeoutMS expired), causing it to be partially non-functional and to surface empty/blank downstream error behavior. The combination of (a) aggressive immediate retries from compose-post and (b) url-shorten's DB impairment produced the repeated url-shorten-service <-> user-mention-service alternating calls and blank error payloads seen in traces, leading to elevated latency and end-to-end failures. The dominant actionable root cause is compose-post-service's lack of retry/backoff controls; url-shorten-mongodb connectivity is a clear contributing failure that triggered/exposed the problem.",

Connection refused') to post-storage-service and dense immediate reconnect attempts; its mounted service-config.json contains timeout_ms but no retry/backoff settings. 3) url-shorten-service pod logs show repeated MongoDB \"No suitable servers found: serverSelectionTimeoutMS expired\" errors during startup (index creation), then server start \u2014 indicating DB connectivity failure/partial impairment. 4) url-shorten and user-mention pods/configs show correct host/port/service selectors (no Kubernetes-level mispointing). 5) No application-level evidence was found that url-shorten or user-mention implement an aggressive retry bug or return malformed/serialized Thrift exceptions (no error traces or ERROR logs in their pods referencing the supplied traceIDs). 6) Tracing did not capture detailed error payloads for url-shorten/user-mention; error_message fields in the traces were blank, consistent with services propagating empty error responses under failure.",
    "investigation_summary": "Prioritized investigations (1\u21925) were executed: priority #1 (url-shorten-service logs/config/traces) ruled out an application-level client retry bug in url-shorten; priority #2 verified correct host/port/service mappings between url-shorten and user-mention; priority #3 validated compose-post \u2194 url-shorten config compatibility and found compose-post did not show calls to url-shorten in the log window while url-shorten showed DB errors; priority #4 examined user-mention and found no evidence it returned malformed errors or called url-shorten; priority #5 (highest-weighted for this outcome) identified compose-post-service's aggressive reconnect behavior and missing retry/backoff config as the amplifier. Correlation: traces show the alternating call pattern, logs show compose-post producing dense retries and url-shorten having DB startup failures. Combined, evidence supports a causal chain where compose-post's aggressive retries amplified transient downstream failures and url-shorten's MongoDB impairment caused partial/empty error behavior, producing the observed end-to-end failures.

Your mission is to triage a Kubernetes application by analyzing the provided data.\n\nYour analysis must adhere to the following rules:\n1.  **Focus**: Identify symptoms at the **pod or service level only**. Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",
    "planner_agent": "You are an expert Site Reliability Engineer. Produce a concise, de-duplicated investigation plan where each task inspects a precise part of the infrastructure to surface the most likely root-cause signals and converge on the true RCA quickly.\n\n**Planning Rules**\n1. For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\nYou are obligated to fill the field with \"the smallest set of tools required to accomplish the task\"\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",
    "rca_agent": "You are an expert DevOps engineer performing focused Root Cause Analysis on a Kubernetes service.\n\nInstructions:\n1. You have full autonomy to select the necessary tools from the toolkit. Decide which tools are required to verify your hypotheses efficiently.\n2. For each tool call, first formulate a clear, testable hypothesis about a possible root cause that can be answered by the result. Avoid broad or exploratory queries.\n3. Each tool call must provide unique, non-overlapping information. Never repeat requests with similar parameters or investigate the same aspect repeatedly in slightly different ways.\n4. Stop investigating, even if you have not reached the budget limit, when you have:\n   - Clear evidence that directly identifies a root cause (or definitively rules one out)\n   - Multiple data points indicating the same failure/cause\n   - Sufficient information to answer the investigation goal\n5. DO NOT:\n   - Repeat or re-run tools unless you are testing a truly new and justified hypothesis\n   - Investigate unrelated resources or expand scope beyond the investigation goal\n6. When you have gathered sufficient, non-redundant evidence (typically after 2-3 targeted tool calls), call submit_final_diagnosis with:\n   - diagnosis: State the precise root cause as it pertains to the investigation goal\n   - reasoning: Support your diagnosis by referencing unique findings from your tool calls\n\nREMEMBER: Quality over quantity. Focus on unique and conclusive findings rather than exhaustive or repetitive investigation\n",
    "supervisor_agent": "You are an expert Site Reliability Engineer analyzing RCA findings to determine the root cause of an incident.\n\nAnalyze all symptoms and investigation findings to:\n1. Identify patterns and correlations across findings\n2. Determine the primary root cause\n3. List all affected resources\n4. Summarize key evidence\n\n**Understanding Task Priority:**\nEach RCA investigation task has been assigned a priority level:\n- Priority 1 = Most important / Most likely to reveal root cause (investigated first)\n- Priority 2, 3, ... = Progressively lower importance\n- Tasks with lower priority numbers should generally have higher weight in your analysis\n- The priority reflects the likelihood that investigating that task/resource would uncover the root cause\n\nUse the priority information to contextualize findings: results from priority 1 tasks are typically more significant for determining root cause than lower priority investigations.\n\n**Detection & Localization Requirements:**\n- **detection**: Set to `true` if any problem/anomaly was detected in the cluster based on the evidence. Set to `false` only if no issues are found.\n- **localization**: Provide a list of ONLY the faulty/problematic components (service names or pod names) directly identified as the root cause. This should be a minimal, precise list - extract ONLY the specific resource(s) that caused the incident, not all affected resources.\n  - Example: If a service \"user-service\" has a misconfiguration causing downstream failures, localization = [\"user-service\"]\n  - Example: If a pod \"database-pod-xyz\" is failing, localization = [\"database-pod-xyz\"]\n  - Leave empty/null if the root cause cannot be localized to a specific service or pod.\n\n**Root Cause Expectations:**\n- Build a causal chain that connects symptoms, investigation evidence, and the precise failure mechanism\n- Cite concrete configuration or runtime details (e.g., \"service expects port 5432 but database listens on 5433\") when diagnosing misconfigurations or integration issues\n- If evidence stops at the symptom level, identify the missing proof and pursue it before finalizing\n\n**Strict Iteration Policy:**\nOnly request another RCA iteration when the existing evidence is insufficient to produce a confident final diagnosis. Never re-run or re-request tasks already marked as completed or currently in progress. When additional work is unavoidable, list only the minimal set of pending task priorities in `tasks_to_be_executed` and clearly justify why each is required. If the current findings support a solid root cause, leave `tasks_to_be_executed` empty and finalize the report.\n\nWhen you need more evidence, ask for the most targeted pending tasks that can close the causal gap (for example, verifying port mappings, credentials, or configuration values at both ends of a failing connection).\n\nProvide a clear, specific root cause statement that explains what caused the incident and why it happened now."

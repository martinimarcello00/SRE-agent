The recorded trace (TraceID 0253c02f3552a0fe) shows an errored span sequence that surfaces the failure to nginx-thrift and an alternating appearance of url-shorten-service and user-mention-service; however, no incoming RPCs from user-mention/url-shorten were found in compose-post logs and the compose-post pod has no env vars pointing to a callback \u2014 instead it relies on a mounted ConfigMap.

(2) nginx-thrift config and logs (priority #2) \u2014 confirmed nginx is correctly configured to call compose-post-service:9090; nginx observed connect() refused to the compose-post endpoint (10.244.1.34:9090). (3) compose-post pod spec/config (priority #3) \u2014 pod has no runtime env overrides and uses a mounted ConfigMap; url-shorten Service exists and is correctly declared, so misconfiguration in Services is unlikely. Correlation: trace error surfaced at compose-post-service, compose-post logs show persistent failures contacting post-storage-service, and nginx cannot reach the compose-post listener \u2014 together indicating a root failure of post-storage-service availability (connection refused) that triggered cascading failures. The apparent rpc alternation in the trace (url-shorten <-> user-mention) was investigated but not supported by service logs; it appears to be a trace artifact or a separate interaction pattern rather than the root cause.",

For each symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, platform) and form a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Ground every hypothesis with `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON. Merge overlapping symptoms into a single resource-focused task.\n3. **Connections (mandatory):** Always create at least one task to inspect the connection between each pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its immediate dependents. Each connection check must be two-sided (e.g., verify `service-a` config for `service-b`'s URL and confirm `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for port/name).\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Use the minimum toolset (ideally one or two commands) to prove/disprove each hypothesis. Broader lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1: direct epicenter checks. Next: connection tasks described above (top-tier; prioritize misconfiguration checks).

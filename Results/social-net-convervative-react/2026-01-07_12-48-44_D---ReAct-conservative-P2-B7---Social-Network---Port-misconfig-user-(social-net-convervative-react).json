Correlated traces showing has_error=true at nginx-thrift with empty messages to these TCP-level failures. Conclusion: the immediate failure mechanism is a client-side upstream port mismatch (nginx-thrift -> compose-post-service port 8080 vs 9090), causing refused TCP connects and RPC failures at the edge. Recommended remediation: update nginx-thrift ConfigMap/Lua to target port 9090 (or change Service to expose 8080 if intended), reload/redeploy nginx-thrift, and add validation (integration test or startup probe) to detect upstream port mismatches.

For each symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, platform) and form a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Ground every hypothesis with `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON.

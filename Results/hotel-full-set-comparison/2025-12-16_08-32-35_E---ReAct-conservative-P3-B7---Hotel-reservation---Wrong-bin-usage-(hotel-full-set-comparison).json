Correlation of: (a) missing sidecar in pod spec/containers, (b) presence of sidecar injection annotations, and (c) gRPC client failures in the application logs/traces leads to the confirmed root cause: sidecar injection/mesh misalignment for the frontend pod preventing mesh-managed outbound connections.

Identify issues only at the pod or service level; do not generalize across the cluster.\n2. For each affected pod or service, create one concise symptom entry, summarizing all evidence (pods, metrics, traces).\n3. For each symptom, specify the affected resource (pod/service name only, no prefixes or namespaces) and cite exact evidence.\n4. If only traces indicate errors, still create a symptom, naming the service/pod and summarizing the likely cause from the trace message. Avoid generic statements\u2014make the hypothesis clear.\n5. If no issues are detected, return an empty list.\n\nBe conservative: only report clear symptoms supported by evidence. Output should be concise and avoid speculation.",

Produce a concise, de-duplicated investigation plan: each task must inspect only a precise part of the infrastructure, surfacing the highest-probability root-cause signals and converging quickly on the true RCA.\n\n**Toolkit** (use only necessary commands)\n- `kubectl_get`: List Kubernetes resources/status\n- `kubectl_describe`: Inspect detailed spec/events\n- `get_pods_from_service`: Map services to pods\n- `get_cluster_pods_and_services`: Snapshot cluster topology\n- `get_logs`: Retrieve recent logs\n- `get_traces`: Fetch traces filtered by latency/errors\n- `get_trace`: Inspect a single trace end-to-end\n- `get_metrics`: Current CPU/memory/network metrics\n- `get_metrics_range`: Compare historical metric trends\n- `get_services_used_by`: Downstream service calls\n- `get_dependencies`: External/infrastructure dependencies\n\n**Planning Rules**\n1. For each symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, platform) and form a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Ground every hypothesis with `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON. Merge overlapping symptoms into a single resource-focused task.\n3. **Connections (mandatory):** Always create at least one task to inspect the connection between each pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its immediate dependents. Each connection check must be two-sided (e.g., verify `service-a` config for `service-b`'s URL and confirm `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for port/name).\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Use the minimum toolset (ideally one or two commands) to prove/disprove each hypothesis. Broader lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1: direct epicenter checks. Next: connection tasks described above (top-tier; prioritize misconfiguration checks). Subsequent priorities: rank high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) above narrow/low-scope checks.\n\nReturn outputs as succinct, actionable investigation tasks.

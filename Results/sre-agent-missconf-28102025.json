This rules out server-side pod crash/readiness or missing endpoints as the cause.\n3) Pod logs & server health: the search pod starts normally, binds port 8082, initializes a Consul agent (reads consul:8500) and shows no server-side gRPC errors, no restarts, and no failing probes \u2014 the server is accepting traffic.\nCombined interpretation: server-side components are healthy and reachable via the K8s Service, but the frontend\u2019s gRPC client cannot establish/choose connections. The pod\u2019s use of Consul (pod log shows consul address/agent) indicates the app stack uses Consul-based discovery; the most likely root cause is a discovery/configuration mismatch on the client side (frontend using Consul resolver or wrong target, or Consul registration/visibility problem), so the client has no resolved/ready backends despite the Service being healthy.\n\nRecommended next steps to remediate/confirm:\n- Check frontend logs for Consul resolver or name-resolution errors and verify the target URI the frontend gRPC client is using (K8s DNS vs Consul target).\n- Verify Consul registration for the 'search' service and that Consul is reachable from the frontend pod (network/DNS/policy). If Consul is not required, switch frontend to use the Kubernetes Service (search.test-hotel-reservation.svc.cluster.local:8082) or fix resolver configuration.\n- If using an external service mesh or sidecar, verify that sidecars are present and healthy for both frontend and search pods and that mutual TLS/HTTP2 expectations match.\n\nThese findings explain why traces show client-side \"no connection available\" while the backend looks healthy; fix is to correct service discovery/configuration on the frontend (or restore Consul registration/connectivity).",

This rules out server-side pod crash/readiness or missing endpoints as the cause.\n3) Pod logs & server health: the search pod starts normally, binds port 8082, initializes a Consul agent (reads consul:8500) and shows no server-side gRPC errors, no restarts, and no failing probes \u2014 the server is accepting traffic.\nCombined interpretation: server-side components are healthy and reachable via the K8s Service, but the frontend\u2019s gRPC client cannot establish/choose connections. The pod\u2019s use of Consul (pod log shows consul address/agent) indicates the app stack uses Consul-based discovery; the most likely root cause is a discovery/configuration mismatch on the client side (frontend using Consul resolver or wrong target, or Consul registration/visibility problem), so the client has no resolved/ready backends despite the Service being healthy.\n\nRecommended next steps to remediate/confirm:\n- Check frontend logs for Consul resolver or name-resolution errors and verify the target URI the frontend gRPC client is using (K8s DNS vs Consul target).\n- Verify Consul registration for the 'search' service and that Consul is reachable from the frontend pod (network/DNS/policy). If Consul is not required, switch frontend to use the Kubernetes Service (search.test-hotel-reservation.svc.cluster.local:8082) or fix resolver configuration.\n- If using an external service mesh or sidecar, verify that sidecars are present and healthy for both frontend and search pods and that mutual TLS/HTTP2 expectations match.\n\nThese findings explain why traces show client-side \"no connection available\" while the backend looks healthy; fix is to correct service discovery/configuration on the frontend (or restore Consul registration/connectivity).",

(3) The geo Deployment reports 1 replica but 0 available, and the geo Service has NO Endpoints \u2014 consistent with the pod crashing/unready. (4) MongoDB pod logs show an init script created admin/root users and mongod restarted with --auth enabled, indicating authentication is required. (5) frontend->search traces (20) show repeated gRPC \"Unavailable: there is no connection available\" errors while the search Service and pod are Running/Ready with endpoints present; pod logs show use of Consul (consul:8500), indicating a client-side discovery/configuration mismatch as the cause of these gRPC errors. (6) rate pod had a single recent Exit Code=2 termination but restarted and appears healthy now.",
    "investigation_summary": "Investigations performed: examined geo pod describe and logs (found repeated terminations, panic during DB init), inspected mongodb-geo Service endpoints and mongod logs (found service endpoint port 27017 and mongod started with --auth after init user creation), checked geo Service and Deployment (no endpoints, 0 available replicas), reviewed frontend->search traces and search Service/pod (search backend healthy but frontend shows client-side 'no connection' errors and logs indicate Consul-based discovery), and inspected rate pod logs/describe (transient crash then recovery). Correlations and pattern analysis: the geo pod CrashLoopBackOff and missing Service endpoints are explained directly by the geo app's inability to connect to MongoDB due to a port misconfiguration; mongod's enabled authentication is a secondary, contributing blocker if clients attempt to reconnect without credentials. The frontend->search gRPC failures were traced to client-side service discovery/configuration (Consul vs Kubernetes Service), independent of the geo outage. Recommended immediate remediations: correct the geo application's MongoDB connection configuration to use port 27017 (and restart the geo Deployment) and/or update connection string from configuration/Secret; ensure geo clients have valid MongoDB credentials (update secrets or coordinate with DB init); investigate and fix the frontend's service-discovery configuration (Consul target vs k8s DNS) to resolve the gRPC \"no connection available\" errors. Additional follow-ups: enable configuration validation and startup health checks for DB connectivity, log and surface auth/credential errors distinctly from connection errors, and capture pre-crash logs/metrics for the rate pod to rule out resource causes."

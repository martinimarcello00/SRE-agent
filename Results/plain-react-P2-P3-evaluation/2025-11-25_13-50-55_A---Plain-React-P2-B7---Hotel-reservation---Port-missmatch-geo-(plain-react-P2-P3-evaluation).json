The gRPC client span for /search.Search/Nearby is span.kind=client with response_code=Unavailable and a log entry containing the exact error message. This ties the Unavailable error to that frontend pod and shows the error originates on the client span. (get_trace result)\n3) get_trace (traceID 5c8a6d96d0d504a8): independently corroborates the same pattern \u2014 frontend hostname frontend-69d95967fb-pj7cq, client spans with response_code=Unavailable and the same error log. (get_trace result)\n4) Pod logs for frontend-69d95967fb-pj7cq show normal startup and evidence of gRPC clients initializing (srv-search entries) but do not show DNS resolution failures. Combined with the precise error text \"there is no connection available\" in client spans, the failure semantics point to the frontend gRPC client exhausting available connections/transport subchannels rather than the service being unreachable via DNS/resolution.\nConclusion: The immediate failures are client-side connection availability errors from frontend-69d95967fb-pj7cq (connection-pool exhaustion). No trace evidence of DNS/service mis-resolution was found."

Therefore the two-sided connection cannot be confirmed: the frontend is not configured to call a specific host/port/name (missing configuration), even though the search Service is present at search:8082.",
                "reasoning": "From describing the frontend Deployment and Pod (frontend and frontend-69d95967fb-pj7cq) there are no environment variables, command-line args, or mounts that specify a search host/port/name (no SEARCH_* or GRPC_SEARCH_* envs, no ConfigMap/secret references). Describing the search Service in test-hotel-reservation shows Service 'search' with port 8082, targetPort 8082, and Endpoints 10.244.1.24:8082. Unique findings: (1) frontend Deployment/Pod: no configured outbound search address/port; (2) search Service: exists at port 8082 with a healthy endpoint. Conclusion: service-side is correct, but frontend lacks explicit configuration to verify it will call 'search:8082' \u2014 this missing configuration is the root cause of the failed two-sided verification."

Frontend pod logs show normal startup and gRPC client initialization but no DNS resolution errors.

The error semantics and short trace latencies (0.35\u20131.7 ms) indicate the failure is immediate on the client side (no network/processing time), consistent with connection-pool/transport exhaustion rather than upstream unreachability.",
    "investigation_summary": "Priority 1 investigation (completed): retrieved error traces for frontend and full traces for two representative failures. Correlated client spans and process tags to localize the failure to pod frontend-69d95967fb-pj7cq. Pod logs were inspected and show normal startup and gRPC client initialization, with no DNS/service resolution errors. Diagnosis: client-side Unavailable errors due to lack of available connections. Priority 2 investigation (completed): inspected frontend Deployment/Pod manifests and found no explicit environment variables or config entries configuring the search backend host/port; inspected Service 'search' and verified it exposes port 8082 with endpoints (10.244.1.24:8082). This confirms the search service is present; the failing calls are originating from the frontend client and failing before network round-trip. Together, higher-priority trace evidence and logs localize the root cause to the frontend pod's gRPC client running out of available connections.\n\nKey causal chain: frontend received requests -> frontend gRPC client attempted outbound RPCs to search -> client immediately returned \"there is no connection available\" (connection-pool exhaustion) -> RPCs failed with Unavailable -> search backend was not reached/used for those requests. There is no trace or log evidence of DNS/service discovery failures or search pod crashes.\n\nRemaining unknowns and recommended follow-ups (not required to conclude root cause): why the frontend client exhausted its connections (possible causes: an explicit connection limit or zeroed pool config, a leak or failure to create new connections, file-descriptor/socket exhaustion, sudden traffic spike, or recent code/config change). Recommended actions: inspect frontend gRPC client connection-pool settings and runtime metrics (open connections, connection-creation errors), check frontend process resource limits (fds), check recent deploy/config changes and incoming request rates at failure time, and optionally confirm search pod readiness/endpoint health (priority 3/4 tasks).",

Your mission is to triage a Kubernetes application by analyzing the provided data.\n\nYour analysis must adhere to the following rules:\n1.  **Focus**: Identify symptoms at the **pod or service level only**. Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

(P2) Config/connection: verified Service mongodb-geo is present and routable; pod envs inspected (some discrepancy in where DB URL comes from noted, but connectivity was observed). (P3) Downstream DB health: mongodb-geo pod is healthy; init scripts ran; MongoDB enabled authorization and is accepting connections, but logs show authorization failures for client operations. (P4) Resource checks: no OOM or resource starvation found. Correlation across findings yields a causal chain: at startup the geo service connects to mongodb-geo and authenticates, attempts test-data operations against geo-db, MongoDB denies the operations due to insufficient privileges for the authenticated principal, application treats failure as fatal and exits -> CrashLoopBackOff.

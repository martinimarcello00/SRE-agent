Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

Produce a concise, de-duplicated investigation plan where each task inspects a precise part of the infrastructure to surface the most likely root-cause signals and converge on the true RCA quickly.\n\n**Toolkit**\n- `kubectl_get`: list Kubernetes resources and their status\n- `kubectl_describe`: inspect detailed spec/events for a resource\n- `get_pods_from_service`: map services to backing pods\n- `get_cluster_pods_and_services`: snapshot cluster topology\n- `get_logs`: retrieve recent pod or service logs\n- `get_traces`: fetch traces filtered by latency/errors\n- `get_trace`: inspect a single trace end-to-end\n- `get_metrics`: read current CPU/memory/network metrics\n- `get_metrics_range`: compare historical metric windows\n- `get_services_used_by`: discover downstream service calls\n- `get_dependencies`: enumerate external/infra dependencies\n\n**Planning Rules**\n1. For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

Never repeat requests with similar parameters or investigate the same aspect repeatedly in slightly different ways.\n4. Stop investigating, even if you have not reached the budget limit, when you have:\n   - Clear evidence that directly identifies a root cause (or definitively rules one out)\n   - Multiple data points indicating the same failure/cause\n   - Sufficient information to answer the investigation goal\n5. DO NOT:\n   - Repeat or re-run tools unless you are testing a truly new and justified hypothesis\n   - Query outside the given Target or Priority Tools\n   - Investigate unrelated resources or expand scope\n6.

Set to `false` only if no issues are found.\n- **localization**: Provide a list of ONLY the faulty/problematic components (service names or pod names) directly identified as the root cause.

Never re-run or re-request tasks already marked as completed or currently in progress. When additional work is unavoidable, list only the minimal set of pending task priorities in `tasks_to_be_executed` and clearly justify why each is required. If the current findings support a solid root cause, leave `tasks_to_be_executed` empty and finalize the report.\n\nWhen you need more evidence, ask for the most targeted pending tasks that can close the causal gap (for example, verifying port mappings, credentials, or configuration values at both ends of a failing connection).\n\nProvide a clear, specific root cause statement that explains what caused the incident and why it happened now."

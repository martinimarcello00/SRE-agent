This caused the mongod process to exit with code 14 and enter a CrashLoopBackOff, leaving the url-shorten-mongodb Service without endpoints and making the URL-shortener functionality unavailable. The TLS issue is the proximate trigger (most likely: invalid/missing certificate or key, wrong file paths in mongod.conf, or file permission/format problems for the mounted secret).",True,True,2,"The agent focused on the correct component (url-shorten-mongodb in the test-social-network namespace) and a real failure mode (mongod crashing), but the identified root cause is TLS/SSL misconfiguration, whereas the injected ground truth is missing MongoDB authentication configuration.

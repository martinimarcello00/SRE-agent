The repeated/cyclic spans are children of compose-post-service spans (not direct nginx child calls), proving the repeated downstream Thrift calls are generated downstream by compose-post-service rather than by nginx-thrift retries or misrouting.

The entry proxy forwards POST /post/compose to the compose-post-service and does not itself fan-out to text/url/user-mention services. The duplicate/cyclic calls originate downstream from compose-post-service (or its Lua client), which is issuing repeated calls into text-service, url-shorten-service and user-mention-service.",
                "reasoning": "1) kubectl_describe (nginx-thrift Deployment) and the mounted ConfigMap show nginx.conf is configured to hand requests to Lua handlers (content_by_lua) such as api/post/compose; nginx is the single-entrypoint and uses Lua scripts mounted from the ConfigMap/volume (no multiple proxy_pass entries or upstream clusters configured that would cause fan-out). 2) kubectl_get of the nginx-thrift ConfigMap (nginx.conf) shows the /api/post/compose location runs 'local client = require \"api/post/compose\"; client.ComposePost();' \u2014 nginx delegates to a single Lua module which then calls the compose-post-service. 3) get_trace for traceID 0041d783ae347494 shows the trace hierarchy: nginx-thrift (p7) -> compose-post-service (p1) -> text/media/unique-id/... -> repeated calls between url-shorten-service (p5) and user-mention-service (p4). The repeated/cyclic spans are children of compose-post-service spans (not direct nginx child calls), proving the repeated downstream Thrift calls are generated downstream by compose-post-service rather than by nginx-thrift retries or misrouting. Together these unique data points identify compose-post-service (or its client logic) as the epicenter of the duplicate/cyclic calls."

There is no evidence of URL/port/name misconfiguration or wrong cluster-DNS usage that would cause misrouting/fanout.",
      "reasoning": "Evidence collected:\n- Deployment (nginx-thrift): Pod template contains env var fqdn_suffix set to \".test-social-network.svc.cluster.local\" (kubectl_describe deployment nginx-thrift). This shows nginx/Lua will construct service FQDNs by appending that suffix.\n- ConfigMap (nginx-thrift): nginx.conf references env fqdn_suffix and loads Lua Thrift client modules (e.g., social_network_UserTimelineService, ComposePostService, UserService). nginx.conf does not hardcode external hostnames/ports, indicating the code resolves services via the fqdn_suffix at runtime (kubectl_describe configmap nginx-thrift).\n- Services: text-service, url-shorten-service, and user-mention-service (namespace: test-social-network) are present and each exposes port 9090 with targetPort 9090 and have endpoints (e.g., text-service Endpoints: 10.244.1.20:9090, url-shorten-service Endpoints: 10.244.1.35:9090, user-mention-service Endpoints: 10.244.1.23:9090) (kubectl_describe service ...).\nConclusion: nginx-thrift's runtime FQDN resolution (via fqdn_suffix) aligns with the cluster Service names and their ports (9090).

The cyclic/duplicate invocations from compose-post-service caused request amplification, elevated end-to-end latency (~1,022\u20131,025 ms in sampled traces) and error responses observed at nginx-thrift (http 500 / has_error=true).",

Findings disproved the hypothesis that nginx-thrift performed fan-out/retries \u2014 nginx delegates to a single Lua module which calls compose-post-service. Trace parent/child relationships show compose-post-service spans generated the repeated downstream calls. Priority-2 checks confirmed no service name/port mismatch that would cause misrouting (fqdn_suffix usage and downstream services exposing port 9090 with ready endpoints). Priority-3 pod log checks for user-mention-service returned no evidence of it initiating reciprocal calls (logs contained only startup line). Combined, the most probable causal chain is: a bug/regression in compose-post-service request-handling or Thrift client code is causing multiple / duplicated Thrift requests per incoming compose request (including loops that generate back-and-forth between url-shorten-service and user-mention-service and repeated text-service invocations), which amplifies downstream traffic, increases latency, and yields errors at the ingress.",

Do not provide cluster-wide analysis or generalizations.\n2.  **Aggregation**: For each pod or service that has issues, create **at most one symptom entry**. Aggregate all related evidence (from pods, metrics, traces) into that single entry.\n3.  **Action**: Synthesize the information to identify and list potential symptoms. For each symptom, pinpoint the affected resource (pod or service) and cite the specific evidence.\n4.  **Resource Naming**: In the `affected_resource` field, provide ONLY the exact resource name without any decorators, prefixes, or namespace qualifiers (e.g., use \"geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\" NOT \"test-hotel-reservation/geo-6b4b89b5f5-rsrh7\").\n5.  **Trace-Only Evidence**: If error traces are the only signals, still produce symptoms by identifying the service (or pod) that owns the failing span and summarizing the suspected issue using the trace error message. Avoid generic \"trace failed\" statements\u2014make the hypothesis explicit (e.g., \"checkout-service may have invalid credentials because trace X shows `401 Unauthorized` calling payment-service\").\n6.  **Empty State**: If the provided data contains no issues, it is correct to return an empty list of symptoms.",

For every symptom, classify the dominant failure domain (app, latency, dependency/config, or platform) and craft a single, testable hypothesis per resource.\n2. Use the `data_dependencies` and `infra_dependencies` JSON to ground every hypothesis. Merge overlapping symptoms into one task per resource.\n3. **Connections (non-negotiable):** Always create at least one task that inspects the connection between every pair of affected resources or the epicenter and its downstream dependents. These tasks must perform explicit two-sided checks (e.g., verify `service-a`'s config for `service-b`'s URL **and** inspect `service-b`'s Kubernetes service definition for the matching port/name) to catch login/URL/port misconfigurations.\n\n**Tool Selection**\n- Pick the minimum tool set (ideally one or two calls) needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Over-broad tool lists are rejected.\n\n**Priority Policy**\n- Assign unique priorities (1..N).\n- Priority 1 is the most direct epicenter investigation. Immediately after that, schedule the connection-check tasks described above; treat them as top-tier because they frequently surface misconfigurations.\n- Remaining priorities should rank other high-impact hypotheses (shared dependencies, severe crashes) ahead of narrow or low-scope checks.\n",

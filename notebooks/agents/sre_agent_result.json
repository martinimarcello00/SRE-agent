Tool-call and billing traces revealed a concentrated burst of automated calls from a background worker with removed throttling/locking, causing quota/budget exhaustion and sustained high request rates. Service-level inspection showed search has a single endpoint and frontend traces repeatedly failed with a client-side 'no connection available' gRPC error, consistent with connection exhaustion under high concurrency. The geo service repeatedly crashed on startup (ExitCode=2) due to missing DB configuration in the pod environment, independent but exposed by the increased load and diagnostic activity. MongoDB showed intermittent SIGTERMs and a mounted 'failure-admin-geo' script was discovered, warranting further security/ops review. The root corrective actions are: (1) immediately stop or throttle the runaway job, (2) restore rate-limiting/locking and add retries/backoff/caching, (3) enforce quotas/alerts to prevent future budget exhaustion, (4) fix geo deployment configuration to include required DB connection variables, (5) remove SPOF by scaling/replicating search or improving connection pooling, and (6) investigate the mounted failure-admin-geo script and MongoDB SIGTERM origin."
